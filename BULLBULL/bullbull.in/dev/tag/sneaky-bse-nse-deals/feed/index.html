<p>Nothing wrong in that, but about 10 months ago it had pledged about 3 crore shares, which were hovering around Rs 15.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a worth of 45 crores. Assuming the financier lent 50%, the company would have gotten a loan of about 22 crores.</p>
<p>On Friday, it revoked the pledge of about 1.57 crore shares, price of which had appreciated to Rs 29-30.</p>
<p>Double.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the proof:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-348 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Insider-deal-screen.jpg" alt="ansal properties insider deals" width="1105" height="519" srcset="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Insider-deal-screen.jpg 1105w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Insider-deal-screen-300x141.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Insider-deal-screen-768x361.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Insider-deal-screen-1024x481.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1105px) 100vw, 1105px" /></p>
<p>The company is Ansal Properties.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying this is a violation of insider trading rules.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just saying that the stock has zoomed from 15 to 30 in a span of 4 months (see the image above), at a time when the real estate market was stagnant. Of course, quality real estate stocks like DLF and Godrej Properties appreciated, but definitely not by 100%, and that too in 5 months.</p>
<p>The Ansal properties pledge was revoked as soon as the share doubled and it was reported to the exchange on 7 July 2017.</p>
<p>Though the transaction is legally above board, I do have the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Was the stock price played around with to revoke the pledge?<br />
(know that no loan replacement is necessary to revoke the pledge because the value has appreciated)</p>
<p>2. Half the pledged shares have been released. Will the stock price still be boosted to a point where the pledged loan can be repaid in full by selling a small part of the 3 crore shares? If this theory proves right, we may see Ansal properties cross 50 bucks.</p>
<p>3. If (2) above is proved right, will the management dispose stocks in the open market to repay the loan?</p>
<p>These are all hypothetical questions and I may be wrong. It&#8217;s just that this deal has sounded a red alert for me and I figured that I should blog about it.</p>
