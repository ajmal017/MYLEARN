<tbody class="row-hover">
<tr class="row-2 even">
	<td class="column-1">Sterlite Technologies is the frontrunner. It is being recommended at this high price by top brokerages and The Serum Institute, a Poonawala firm, has picked up a large chunk around 225 (current levels).</td><td class="column-2">Infosys</td><td class="column-3">Alankit, pitching it up on top because I own shares. This is one solid stock, check their website out for more information on a wide range of e-Gov services they provide.</td><td class="column-4">HCC.. this stock is troubled by debt, but has super potential. It has already carved Lavasa, a smart city and many landmark infra like the Bandra-Worli Sea Link. But it is a long term debt because it will take a long time and litigations to be free from debt and NHAI award disputes.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-3 odd">
	<td class="column-1">Himachal Futuristic, the 3rd fastest growing company in India. HFCL also has close links with Jio. It makes for a solid long term buy.</td><td class="column-2">TCS</td><td class="column-3">Vakrangee Software. This is an old fav.</td><td class="column-4">Larsen &amp; Toubro, super infra company that has already completed the Jaipur smart city contract and has bagged Nagpur.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-4 even">
	<td class="column-1">Power Grid Corp -- it also lays cables (aside from eggs :))</td><td class="column-2">RS Software (it built the UPI platform). It is making losses now and much depends on how the management steers it into profits.</td><td class="column-3">IT companies like TCS, Infosys, MindTree, Tech Mahindra, HCL Infosystem, Wipro (the usual suspects)</td><td class="column-4">Sterlite Technologies also can help build smarter cities. It is a versatile multibagger.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-5 odd">
	<td class="column-1">RailTel -- not listed yet, but IPO is announced. Don't miss this stock that has the capability to reach out to virtually every town and village in India.</td><td class="column-2">TVS Electronics (POS machines, thermal printers)</td><td class="column-3">Tera Software (a fancied stock, but lagging now. It already has e-Gov contracts)</td><td class="column-4">Honeywell Automation (HVAC, Fire safety)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-6 even">
	<td class="column-1">Vindhya Telelinks, another major player</td><td class="column-2">(add your own in the comments below. Thanks.)</td><td class="column-3">Cosyn (I just came across this company. IIt looks good on the surface and is fairly cheap, you can research it if you like). Just remember one thing, when Cosyn was 250, everyone said it will fly (on Twitter).. now it is at 70.. so do your research well.</td><td class="column-4">ABB (Asea Brown Boveri). This is a classy stock that is into most technologies that will shape the future. </td>
</tr>

	<td class="column-1">(add your own in the comments below. Thanks.)</td><td class="column-2"></td><td class="column-3">ABM Knowledgeware</td><td class="column-4">L&amp;T Infotech (Internet of Things, </td>
