<p><strong>AMORPHOUS</strong>: Such plastics soften over a wide range of temperatures, and bond easily well using adhesives. These are easy to thermoform.</p>
<p><strong>SEMI CRYSTALLINE</strong>: Such plastics have better chemical resistance, electrical properties, and work best for bearing, wear and structural applications. But these are difficult to thermoform or bond, and have a sharp melting point.</p>
<p>Now there are four categories of plastics:</p>
<p><strong>Commodity Plastics</strong>: Used in high volume and wide range of applications like packaging, clothing, beverage and trash containers, household products.</p>
<p><strong>Engineering Plastics</strong>: These have better mechanical/thermal properties and are more expensive than commodity plastics. These are used for small objects or low-volume applications (example: mechanical parts).</p>
<p><strong>High Temperature Plastics</strong>: Superior heat-resistant plastics that are suitable in mechanical engineering, workplace technology, textiles. medical, chemical and automobile industry.</p>
<p><strong>Extreme Temperature Plastics</strong>: Melt only in temperatures of 150+° C and are used as reinforcing agents in advanced applications like aerospace, medical, defence.</p>
<p>Now here are the different types of plastics, their uses and the companies that manufacture them. Note that this is a work in progress post and I&#8217;ll keep updating company names as and when I get information:</p>
