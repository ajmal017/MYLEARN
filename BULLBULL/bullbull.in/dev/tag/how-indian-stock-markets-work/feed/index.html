<p>Stock monitored was Gravita Industries.</p>
<p>The key here is that many investors view the book before making buying or selling decisions and some operators take advantage of that.</p>
<p>Gravita opened today at around 169 and quickly 171.</p>
<p>At around 10 AM I opened Gravita&#8217;s book and saw that there were about 8,00,000 buyers and 2,20,000 sellers.</p>
<p>15-20 minutes later the price dropped to 169. The number of buyers and sellers were 7,00,000 and 2,40,000 respectively.</p>
<p>Now Gravita is a fancied stock and any eager investor may have bought the stock around 170 levels after viewing the book.</p>
<p>In another 30-40 minutes or so (I do not recollect the time, but you can check the timestamp on my screenshots), the price dropped to 165-166 but the buyers still outnumbered sellers. Over time, the price kept dropping until the price was between 163-164. At these levels, the buyers and sellers were almost equal in number.</p>

Here is the situation when the price was around 165. You can see the buyers outnumber the sellers, giving a bullish signal for investors who follow the book.</p></div>

<div id="attachment_895" style="width: 1376px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-895 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gravita4.png" alt="learn to read stock markets" width="1366" height="768" srcset="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gravita4.png 1366w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gravita4-300x169.png 300w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gravita4-768x432.png 768w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gravita4-1024x576.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The same story continued even at 2.25 PM by which time the price had dropped to 157 levels.</p></div>
<p>The stock closed around 156.90.</p>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<p>If you invest in stocks by viewing the book, then keep the following in mind:</p>
<p>If buyers outnumber sellers and the price continues to drop &#8212; then it implies there is either a hidden seller or a big seller who has not registered a sell transaction. You should get out of such stocks that exhibit such price movements within an hour of getting into the trade. However,, this does not translate to a full blown bearish signal especially if you know that the stock is high quality. It represents operator selling.</p>
<p>Conversely, if sellers outnumber buyers and the price continues to rise &#8212; it implies there is either a hidden buyer or a big buyer who has not registered a buy transaction. This is an extremely bullish signal. If you come across such stocks, you should immediately buy them.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for now. Ciao.</p>
