		<description><![CDATA[Hi sir,
It seems to be an operator driven stock now.
Up 3.8 % until now - (12.10  14-11-2017) without much volume.
Operators are filling the top of order book with bid quantities of 1 each to hide genuine  bid prices.
What tactic you will recommend in similar situations ?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems you have not read the annual report. This company develops software for its core applications such as water testing, desalination, extracting minerals from wastewater, etc. The intangible assets represent software, which is written off over 3 years. here is an extract from their annual report:

Intangible assets and amortisation

 Intangible assets includes system and application software. These intangible assets are recognised only where
future economic benefits attributable to such assets are expected to flow to the Company and the cost of such
assets can be reasonably measured. Software is initially recognised at cost and carried to subsequent years at cost
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

The computer software is amortised over an expected benefit period of 3 years on a straight line method (SLM).
Intangible assets are derecognised when no future economic benefits are expected from their use and subsequent
disposal]]></description>
