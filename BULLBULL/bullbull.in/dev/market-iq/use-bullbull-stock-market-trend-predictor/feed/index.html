		<description><![CDATA[Hi Raghvendra, Thanks for the interaction:

Please use my tool after 3.30 on any market day for predicting trends. Day traders can use it after 2 PM after meaningful volumes have built up.

I&#039;ll give you an example. We saw Exide in an uptrend by 11 AM today when it was at 220. We checked the open interest data and all 3 parameters (OI, volume and price) were up. It closed at 224.

And, yes, you can trade in cash market as well based on the trend. Please apply you own judgment while trading, we are mere facilitators.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Sunil Sir,
You said that if market is rising and open interest is rising the sign is BULLISH

My question is

Market rising means should we consider at the market hours ie 9 am to 3.30 pm or the figures given in red (Bear) or green(Bull) in the above example.

Secondly can we trade in all ie equities,F&#038;O,Options or only equities.
and  do we need to trade only if the result is Neutral or else we can trade if it is Up or Down also.]]></description>
