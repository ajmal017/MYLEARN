<p>The Ichimoku Cloud is like a Swiss Knife indicator that suggests support/resistance, direction of momentum or trend, and alerts you when a buy or sell gets trigerred.</p>
<p>It is like a MACD, Multiple MA, mini Fibonnacci.</p>
<p>Though it looks visually complicated, it is a very simple indicator. In this tutorial, I will stick to the basics, avoid theÂ  Japanese lingo, and help you visually understand the signals without getting into a deep analysis.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="calculation" class="sectionedit3">The 5 Elements of the Ichimoku Indicator</h2>
<div class="level2">
<pre class="code"><a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ichimoku-Lines.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2048" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ichimoku-Lines.jpg" alt="elements of ichimoku" width="1346" height="625" srcset="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ichimoku-Lines.jpg 1346w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ichimoku-Lines-300x139.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ichimoku-Lines-768x357.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ichimoku-Lines-1024x475.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1346px) 100vw, 1346px" /></a></pre>
<p><strong>Conversion Line</strong>: Think of it as a, more or less, 9 Day EMA</p>
<p><strong>Base Line</strong>:Â Think of it as a, more or less, 26 Day EMA</p>
<p><strong>Lead 1</strong>: Average of Conversion and Base Lines</p>
<p><strong>Lead 2</strong>: Average of (52-period high + 52-period low)</p>
<p><strong>Lagging Span</strong>: Current price, plotted 26 periods in the past so that traders can view the exact current price while analyzing the other elements of the Ichimoku. Also, this somehow plays a role in shifting the cloud forward by 26 periods.</p>
<h2 id="calculation" class="sectionedit3">Understanding the &#8220;Cloud&#8221; in the Ichimoku Indicator</h2>
<p>Study the image above. You will see two peculiarities:</p>
<p>1. That the area between lines Lead 1 and Lead 2 is either shaded light red or light green</p>
<p>2. That the cloud extends much beyond the current price (extends it by 26 periods).</p>
<p>A light green cloud is formed when Lead 1 Crosses Lead 2 (the shorter average shooting above the longer average) and a light red cloud is formed when Line 2 pierces Line 1 (the longer average falling below the shorter average).</p>
<p>(2) is extremely important because it helps traders determine future levels of support or resistance. It works like a Fibonacci levels indicator as you will figure out when you are done with the article.</p>
<p>Obviously, you&#8217;d have figured out that the red cloud denotes bearishness and the blue cloud indicates bullishness. That is ok, but there is a certain method of analyzing the Ichimoku.</p>
<h2>Setting Up the Ichimoku Indicator</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve used the following colour codes:</p>
</div>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ichimoku-Cloud-color-coding.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2058" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ichimoku-Cloud-color-coding.jpg" alt="how to set up ichimoku cloud" width="1346" height="625" srcset="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ichimoku-Cloud-color-coding.jpg 1346w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ichimoku-Cloud-color-coding-300x139.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ichimoku-Cloud-color-coding-768x357.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ichimoku-Cloud-color-coding-1024x475.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1346px) 100vw, 1346px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Conversion Line</strong> &#8211; Red<br />
<strong>Base Line</strong> &#8211; Blue<br />
<strong>Lagging Span</strong> &#8211; Pink<br />
<strong>Lead 1</strong> &#8211; Green<br />
<strong>Lead 2</strong> &#8211; Orange</p>
<div class="level2">
<h2 id="calculation" class="sectionedit3">How to Interpret Buy and Sell Signals Using the Ichimoku Cloud</h2>
<h3><strong>BUY SIGNALS</strong></h3>
<p><strong>CONVERSION LINE CROSSES BASE LINE UPWARDS</strong>: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bullish for traders or investors depending on the time period you are using</span>. If you use 15m-1 hour candles, the signal can hold good for 1-2 days, and longer if you use a longer period.</p>
<p><strong>WHEN PRICE CROSSES CONVERSION LINE UPWARDS: </strong>This is a clear bullish signal. However, the price should hold for 1-2 candles above the conversion line before you make any trade.</p>
<h3><strong>SELL SIGNALS</strong></h3>
<p><strong>CONVERSION LINE CROSSES BASE LINE DOWNWARDS</strong>: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bearish for traders or investors depending on the time period you are using</span>. If you use 15m-1 hour candles, the signal can hold good for 1-2 days, and longer if you use a longer period.</p>
<p><strong>WHEN PRICE SLIDES BELOW BASE LINE: </strong>This is a clear bearish signal. However, the price should hold for 1-2 candles below the Base line before you short the stock.</p>
<h2 id="calculation" class="sectionedit3">How to Interpret Trends Using the Ichimoku Cloud</h2>
<h4><strong>UPWARD TREND</strong></h4>
<p><strong>When the price is above the cloud, the stock is in an uptrend. If the cloud is green when the price is up, it implies that the uptrend is strong. If the cloud is red, it implies the uptrend is weak.</strong></p>
<h4><strong>DOWNWARD TREND</strong></h4>
<p><strong>When the price is below the cloud, the stock is in a downtrend. If the cloud is red when the price is down, it implies that the downtrend is strong.Â  If the cloud is green, it implies the downtrend is weak.</strong></p>
<h4><strong>NO TREND (In a range)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>The rangebound phase is triggered the prices move inside the cloud.</strong></p>
<h2 id="calculation" class="sectionedit3">How Ichimoku Cloud Sets Support and Resistance Levels</h2>
<p>Lead 1 and Lead 2 act as support (if the price is above the cloud) and resistance (if the price is below the cloud).</p>
<h2 id="calculation" class="sectionedit3">How Ichimoku Cloud Sets FUTURE Support and Resistance Levels</h2>
<p>One solid advantage of Ichimoku is that it sets future support and resistance levels by plotting lines Lead 1 and Lead 2 twenty-six periods into the future. The following examples will help you understand how to interpret these.</p>
<h2>EXAMPLES THAT WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HOW ICHIMOKU CLOUD WORKS</h2>
<p>A. NIFTY 1-DAY ICHIMOKU (Note that the trend can change as prices reverse):</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Example-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2062" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Example-1.jpg" alt="how to analyze ichimoku cloud" width="1366" height="616" srcset="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Example-1.jpg 1366w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Example-1-300x135.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Example-1-768x346.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Example-1-1024x462.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px" /></a></p>

<p>A. NIFTY 1-MONTH ICHIMOKU (current):</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Example-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2068" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Example-3.jpg" alt="how to read bull and bear trends using the ichimoku" width="1346" height="643" srcset="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Example-3.jpg 1346w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Example-3-300x143.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Example-3-768x367.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Example-3-1024x489.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1346px) 100vw, 1346px" /></a></p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s about it. Practice it a few times and I&#8217;m sure you will find it immensely helpful like I do.</p>

<p>Well, the truth is that most of us do not have the inclination or patience to be a value investor. Let&#8217;s face it &#8211; we are all greedy and will jump in at the slightest opportunity based on how we feel or hear.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not what a value investor does.</p>
<p><strong>A value investor is a cold, thinking and heartless investor who will wait patiently for stocks to get underpriced, and he also will wait patiently and track the stock he owns until it achieves its full potential.</strong></p>
<p>The key to value investing therefore is toÂ buy an underpriced stock, hold it patiently and keep tracking its performance (of course, a value investor does sell out if the company&#8217;s performance does not meet</p>
<p>Here are the moves that a value investor makes, and if you make the same moves without succumbing to the wiles of the market, it will do you a world of good.</p>
<h3>INTRINSIC VALUE CALCULATION</h3>
<p>In simple terms, the intrinsic value of a stock can be said to be the actual value of a company based on its long term projections.</p>
<p>The idea is to buy the stock if it is available at a significant discount to its intrinsic value. It is arrived at by estimating the growth rate of a company in the long run and then applying that growth rate to the current EPS.</p>
<p>Intrinsic value is calculated based on a formula that extrapolates the near and long term growth rates of a company and applies the calculation to the current EPS.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/intrinsic-value-calculator/"><strong>You can always use the Intrinsic Value Calculator here.</strong></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example. I calculated the Intrinsic Value of Gujarat Pipavav and found that it works up to 293, assuming current EPS of 4, near term growth rate of 5% for the next 5 years, which climbs to 7% thereafter. The probability of this coming true was set at 75%.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/intrinsic-value.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2029" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/intrinsic-value.jpg" alt="intrinsic value calculator" width="611" height="442" srcset="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/intrinsic-value.jpg 611w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/intrinsic-value-300x217.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" /></a></p>
<p>The Intrinsic value based on these numbers worked out to 293. The CMP is 142. So, my rule of thumb says that for the long term the gain % does not appear attractive, and therefor this stock does not make a value buy at the moment.</p>
<h3>MARGIN OF SAFETY CALCULATION</h3>
<p>The margin of safety concept is a fancy one. In plain English, the margin of safety is the discount percentage you are getting on the stock.</p>
<p>For example, in Gujarat Pipavav&#8217;s case, the CMP is 45% of the intrinsic value, so your discount on intrinsic value is about 55%.</p>
<p>You can look at the margin or safety by any angle you are comfortable with. For example,</p>
<p>You may consider anything over 3x BV as expensive, or you can consider 20+PE as expensive &#8211; it all depends on your calculation.</p>
<h3>DISRUPTION</h3>
<p>Some of the age old principles of value investing no longer apply in today&#8217;s world. If you have noticed, our world is rapidly changing. Electric vehicles, e-learning work-at-home, paperless economy, plant meats, 3D printers, insolvency processes, protectionism, etc., are reshaping the way we live and do business.</p>
<p>Every value investor must therefore MUST keep on top of disruption. If he finds that his company cannot keep on top of disruption, he must hawk his stock.</p>
<h3>UNFOLLOW THE HERD?</h3>
<p>Traditional value investors in the Warren Buffett mould do not chase what the herd is missing. They go for relatively unfancied stocks that have potential to grow.</p>
<p>In the bargain, these idiot traditional value investors missing out investing in multibaggers such as Google and Amazon.</p>
<p>So, if you want to be a modern value investor, you must look at everything and chase a business that has a solid business model that is available at a discount.</p>
<h3>RIP VAN WINKLE INVESTING</h3>
<p>The traditional model of value investing is to buy a quality stock at a discount and hold it for several years. Of course, you should track it.</p>
<p>Well, this does hold true. However, if you are a trader or someone who makes a living off the markets, then you cannot be expected to be patient.</p>
<p>Think about this &#8211; top value investors say that even if your stock appreciates 60%-70% in as little as 3-4 months, don&#8217;t sell it. Keep holding.</p>
<p>So, if you are are prepared be a Rip van Winkle to your stocks, value investing is for you.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all there is to know. Thanks for dropping by and reading this piece.</p>

It is computer-activated and is usually set in advance.</p>
<p>The idea behind placing a &#8220;stop loss&#8221; order is to protect the trader from incurring losses that exceed his targets.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples:</p>
<p><b>Examples</b>Â :</p>
<p><b>Stop Loss For Bear Trades</b><br />
You short sell Tata Steel shares at Rs 550 because you reckon the price will fall. But you&#8217;d like to limit your loss in case the stock rises. Therefore, you place a Stop Loss Buy order at 570 because a 20 bucks loss is the maximum you are willing to bear. If Tata Steel starts rising and zooms to 590, your short sale will get covered at 570, and you will end up losing 20 bucks instead of 40. If Tata Steel falls as per your expectations, you can cover it book profits.</p>
<p><b>Stop Loss For Bull Trades</b><br />
You buy Tata Steel shares at Rs 550 because you reckon the price will rise. But you&#8217;d like to limit your loss in case the stock falls. Therefore, you place a Stop Loss Sell order at 530 because a 20 bucks loss is the maximum you are willing to bear. If Tata Steel starts falling and drops to 510, your position will get sold at 530, and you will end up losing 20 bucks instead of 40. If Tata Steel rises as per your expectations, you can cover it book profits.</p>
<h4>Advantages of Stop Loss</h4>
<ol>
<li>It protects traders and short term investors from unbudgeted losses.</li>
<li>Helps traders focus on many deals.</li>
<li>As stop loss trades are executed automatically, and therefore it saves the trader a lot of administrative time and unnecessary tension.</li>
<li>It allows traders to budget their losses and gain better control of their trading capital.</li>
<li>It helps discipline traders.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Disadvantages of Stop Loss</h4>
<ol>
<li>These days markets are governed more by news than by technicals. Moreover, there is massive algo trading going on these days, ad so it is possible that a stop loss order gets triggered unexpectedly and then reverses, leaving a bad taste in your mouth and an unnecessary hole in your pocket.</li>
<li>Setting a stop loss is tricky and there&#8217;s no one answer for the optimum stop loss trigger.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Who Should Set Stop Loss Levels &#8211; Trader or Investor?</h4>
<p>Stop loss is a must for every trader (day, short term, swing trader) if he wants to protect his capital from extreme risk in an uncertain environment. If you are a trader who wants to protect capital, you MUST apply a stop loss to your every trade.</p>
<p>Now comes the interesting part &#8211; Should an investor work with a stop loss level?</p>
<p>Well, an investor knows his stocks much better than a trader does. Traders typically work on charts while an investor researches the business model, fundamentals and management quality.</p>
<p>Typically seasoned investors are so sure about their stocks that they average their stocks on the way down.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example: I had picked up LIC Housing Finance at 280 or so in 2012. In 2013 it crashed to 160 or so. It was a quality stock, and I averaged it when it started recovering (at around 190), and brought the cost down to 235. Within 8 months it zoomed to 400.</p>
<p>So, the lesson is that if you know your stock well, a stop loss does not apply UNLESS:</p>
<p>1. Corporate governance issues emerge<br />
2. Company gets involved in a shady transaction<br />
3. Business model gets disrupted because of obsolescence<br />
4. Management allows competitors to step on their toes<br />
5. Any other global factor renders the company&#8217;s business unprofitable</p>
<p>So, if you are an investor, you already would have understood what to do.</p>
<h4>What Stop Loss Level Should I set?</h4>
<p>Stop loss is a must for every trader (day, short term, swing trader) if he wants to protect his capital from extreme risk in an dicey market.</p>
<p>There are four methods of setting a stop loss level:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Rule of Thumb</strong>: by ascertaining the risk-reward ratio for that trade and determining how much you are willing to lose.</p>
<p>2 <strong>Percentage</strong>: Professional traders book profits or losses (or train these) based on percentages. If your trading rule is to make or lose 3% per trade, you should apply that % while setting up stop loss levels. You also should train stop loss levels too. For example, if you have shorted Tata Steel at 550, and it falls to 534, you&#8217;d have achieved your profit target. However, if you expect the stock to fall further, you can trail your stop loss to say about 545 and keep enjoying the fall. If the stock rises and if your stop loss order gets triggered, you anyway end up making a cool 1% gain.</p>
<p><strong>3. Support Levels</strong>: Professional traders typically check retracement or support levels on the charts and determine theirÂ  stop losses based on their analyses.</p>
<p><strong>4. Moving Averages</strong>: Professional traders also can set stop losses based on the near term moving average. The near term moving average can be a 1-hour moving average for a day trader or a daily moving average for a swing trader.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s all there is to it. Just remember that stop losses are mandatory for all types of traders, and you always must set these if you want discipline in your trading life.</p>

<h3>Here is a practical lesson on how to predict commodity cycles.</h3>
<h1><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Example</strong>: Copper</span></h1>
<h2><strong>STEP 1</strong>: Access Historical Charts</h2>
<p>I Googled &#8220;Copper Price Historical Chart,&#8221; and landed on this <a href="http://www.macrotrends.net/1476/copper-prices-historical-chart-data"><strong>45 year chart</strong>.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Copper-historical-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1991" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Copper-historical-1.jpg" alt="predict copper super cycle" width="768" height="582" srcset="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Copper-historical-1.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Copper-historical-1-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>The recessionary periods are represented by vertical gray bars. As you can see that the prices of copper started spiking from 2003-04 onwards, crashed after the 2008 bust and then picked up from 2010. Volumes also have picked up from 2010 on, and the copper price spiked to $4.50 (per lb) by 2013-14, and then subsequently corrected. Thereafter it resumed its upward march and is currently at around $3.05 with support at $1.50 and resistance at $4.50. As you can see, the volumes have picked up in recent years, which is a bullish signal.</p>
<h2><strong>STEP </strong>2: Search For The Commodity&#8217;s Global Global Demand in the Near Future</h2>
<p>The next step was to figure out how copper demand will pan out in the near future. I Googled &#8220;global copper demand 2020&#8221; and landed on a <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://minerals.statedevelopment.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/294631/Copper_to_the_World_Vanessa_Davidson_Keynote_address_27_June_2017.pdf">mid-2017 document that discussed about the global copper demand and supply.</a></span></strong></p>
<p><em>(You can get authoritative documents for any commodity so long you know how to search intelligently on Google.)</em></p>
<p>In this document I learned that:</p>
<p>a. Substantial capacities were added between 2011-16 and that capacities were not expected to increase much between 2017-2021.</p>

<p>b. That demand will outstrip supply as we head towards 2020, a factor that will push prices higher.</p>

<p>c. That no substantial investment in copper mines is expected so long prices do not rise dramatically.</p>
<p>d. Prices are expected to rise faster than costs, resulting in better margins.</p>
<p>e. That the supply of copper scrap increased substantially, a factor that helped keep prices in check despite demand spiking up.</p>
<p>f. That China&#8217;s industrialization cycle may end by 2026, a factor that will ensure that copper prices do not spike up. In fact, it is expected that copper prices will remain steady after 2026 or taper off.</p>
<h2><strong>STEP 3</strong>: Search for the Commodity&#8217;s Uses</h2>
<div>Googling &#8220;uses of copper&#8221; helped me discover that copper is used in the following applications:</div>
<div></div>
<div>a. Electrical equipment because it conducts heats and electricity efficiently.</div>
<div>b. Construction (plumbing, roofing, etc.)</div>
<div>c. Industrial machinery</div>
<div>d. Water purification</div>
<div>e. As a poison in agriculture (copper sulfate)</div>
<div>f. Other minor applications such as detecting sugar.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The biggest takeway from these uses was that the boom in electric vehicles and technology (advanced electronics that may trigger technological obsolescence) will drive demand for copper going forward.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="https://www.copper.org/education/history/us-history/g_fact_future.html"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>I also Googled &#8220;future uses of copper,</strong></span>&#8220;</a> and learned that copper will be used in the following applications that have potential in the future:</div>
<div></div>
<div>a. Solar energy</div>
<div>b. Earth-coupled heat pumps</div>
<div>c. Electric Vehicles</div>
<div>d. Electronics (as usual)</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<h2><strong>STEP 4</strong>: Global Disruptions</h2>
<p>The world is now cruising uncomfortably on rocking terrain. America has triggered a global trade war, countries are resorting to protectionism, and there are geopolitical tensions (N Korea-USA, Israel-Iran).</p>
<p>Any escalation of any one situation can lead to a drop in commodity prices (except precious metals).</p>
<h2><strong>STEP 5</strong>: Weigh the Bullish and Bearish Factors</h2>

<h2><strong>STEP 6</strong>: Analysis</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Â Though demand of copper outstrips supply at the moment, the increased supply of copper scrap and the possibility of capacities getting commissioned have kept prices in check. Nevertheless, the demand for copper will increase as EVs and solar energy applications worm their way into daily life.</p>
<p>At this moment, it will be safe to say that there is nothing majorly bullish about copper because if prices spike up, new capacities will be added very quickly, and existing production disruptions also will get set right, leading to a correction.</p>
<p>Therefore, as things stand, with the possibility of trade wars upon us, we can assume that copper will be range bound with support at $1.50 and resistance at $4.50. Anything over $4 or so will make new capacities kick in.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>Â Well, this is more or less it. You can try this method for any commodity and check how it works. You also can dig deeper by Googling for terms such as</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;why isÂ  (commodity&#8217;s) supply disrupted&#8221;</div>
<div>&#8220;seasonal factors that impact (commodity&#8217;s) production (or, demand).&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Good luck, and drop in a line if you found this article helpful.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PS: If I were you, I&#8217;d buy a quality copper scrap recycling stock and hold it for 3 years. It will become a sure multibagger.</strong></span></div>

<p>That said, beginners or experts, profits are profits. So, you can try this out even if you&#8217;re a pro.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before you use this setup, know that it works best for the Indices (Nifty, Bank Nifty, etc.). It also can work for individual stocks, and you should experiment with it.</strong></span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a step by step guide:</p>
<ol>
<li>Register for free at <a href="https://in.investing.com"><strong>Investing.com</strong></a></li>
<li>Search for any stock, or for NSEI, which represents the Nifty Index. I have used the Nifty in this example and all that I write here, represents actual trades. View this image and let&#8217;s move to the next step.<br />
<a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trading-setup-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1970" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trading-setup-1.jpg" alt="technical analysis for beginners" width="1340" height="698" srcset="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trading-setup-1.jpg 1340w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trading-setup-1-300x156.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trading-setup-1-768x400.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trading-setup-1-1024x533.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px" /></a></li>
<li>Now add the following indicators:<br />
a. 20 Day Moving Average<br />
b. 50 Day Moving Average<br />
c.Â 100 Day Moving Average<br />
d. 200 Day Moving Average<br />
(you will have to repeatedly click on the Moving Average indicator and then set the periods and the line colours)<br />
e. Add the RSI (the default is set to 14 Days, which is cool)</li>
<li>Now register for free at <strong><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/">TradingView.com</a></strong> &#8211; know that Trading View delivers delayed data to free accounts but as the trade setup suggested here lasts at least 45 minutes to 2 hours, the delay does not matter as much.<br />
Now check this image out:<br />
<a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Best-Trading-setup.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1972" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Best-Trading-setup.jpg" alt="class on technical indicators" width="1044" height="660" srcset="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Best-Trading-setup.jpg 1044w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Best-Trading-setup-300x190.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Best-Trading-setup-768x486.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Best-Trading-setup-1024x647.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1044px) 100vw, 1044px" /></a></li>
<li>Open the Nifty Index chart and set up the following indicators (icon circled in red)<br />
a. Supertrend<br />
b. Squeeze Momentum Indicator (You&#8217;ll find this under the same icon in the Public Libraries).</li>
<li>Now add one more indicator &#8211; Ultimate Moving Average &#8211; Multiple Time Frames (CM_Ultimate_MA-MTF)</li>
</ol>
<p>Right, we&#8217;re all set up.</p>
<p><strong>UNDERSTANDING THE INDICATORS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Moving Averages</strong> are the average of the stock price for a certain period (20-day, 50-day, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>RSI</strong> is a momentum indicator. Anything over 70-80 indicates overbought; anything below 30-20 indicates oversold. In between the trend keeps moving up or down per price movement.</p>
<p><strong>Supertrend</strong> uses <strong>ATR</strong> (Average True Range) calculations and places buy and sell pointers (arrows) on charts.</p>
<p><strong>Squeeze Momentum Indicator</strong> calculates volatility of a stock. When volatility drops to 0 or near 0 levels, it implies that the stock is getting ready for an explosive move in any direction. Therefore to use the Squeeze Momentum Indicator, you must wait for a confirmation (the next formation) before taking a position. Or, if Supertrend or Untimate MA suggest a buy when volatility is down, you can act based on your risk appetite.</p>
<p><strong>Ultimate Moving Average</strong> auto calculates MA swigs and signals a buy or a sell by turning green or red respectively. It overlays the main price chart,</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how your Trading View chart should look after setup:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trade-setup.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2040" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trade-setup.jpg" alt="Trade setup technicals" width="1311" height="615" srcset="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trade-setup.jpg 1311w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trade-setup-300x141.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trade-setup-768x360.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trade-setup-1024x480.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1311px) 100vw, 1311px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>HOW TO TRADE WITH THIS SETUP (This was written before adding the Ultimate Moving Average indicator. Remember that this indicator will give you sharper signals than Supertrend (as you can see from the chart above) and then you can use Supertrend more as a confoirmatory signal)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>As the market was choppy, and the future uncertain, a decision was taken to focus on day trading.</li>
<li>Accordingly, the candlestick time period was set to 15-minutes. Investors can play around with 1-Day or 1-week settings as well, while traders can also try out the 30-minute setup. My favorite is the 15 minute time intra day period.</li>
<li>At about 11.45 AM, the Nifty spot price crossed the 20 DMA (at around 9995), indicating bullishness. At the same time the RSI also started moving up from 45 levels.</li>
<li>Interestingly, at around 12 PM, the Squeeze Momentum Indicator displayed volatility at its lowest (near 0), indicating something big was about to happen. The next 2 bars confirmed a bullish trend for the day.</li>
<li>The Supertrend indicator threw up a buy signal at around 12.45 PM, when Nifty was 10015. All systems were a go then.</li>
<li>Now, at 11.45 the Nifty 10000 28 April CE was available at 48; and between 12.30 and 12.45 PM, it was available at 60 and 73 respectively. It was snapped up at all levels (48, 60, 73).</li>
<li>The Nifty started spiking and the 10000 CE hit about 117 resulting in handsome gains.</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, this setup works for me and it should work for you as well. Try it, but do not trade for real until you are comfortable with it (it will take 4-5 days). Also, do not be rash. Watch the news, technicals, etc., before attempting any trades and always work with a SL. Good luck.</p>

<p>To figure out support and resistance levels, chartists draw trendlines.</p>
<p><strong>A trendline, therefore, is a sloping line (that you draw) which helps you identify levels of support or resistance.</strong></p>
<h3>HOW TO INTERPRET TRENDLINES</h3>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1942" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-2-1024x457.jpg" alt="how to analyze trendlines" width="640" height="286" srcset="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-2-1024x457.jpg 1024w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-2-300x134.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-2-768x343.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-2.jpg 1343w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>a.Â If the price moves up and pierces the trendline, it is a bullish signal. In the figure above (RIL, 1-Day Candlesticks Chart, price adjusted for bonus), you can see that so long RIL&#8217;s price remained below the trendline, it moved in a range. But the minute it rose above the trendline (Ex Bonus 470, CB 940) it raced all the way to 533 XB (1066 CB).</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1943" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-3-1024x459.jpg" alt="learn how to draw trendlines" width="640" height="287" srcset="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-3-1024x459.jpg 1024w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-3-300x134.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-3-768x344.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-3.jpg 1339w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Here is one more figure to chew on, a continuation of RIL&#8217;s trend. After hitting 533 XB, it fell to 409 XB, and then in October 2017, it broke out of the new trendline at around 430 XB. Then on there was no stopping it as it went on to more than double in the span of 2-3 months.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1944" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-4.jpg" alt="how to understand trendlines" width="800" height="373" srcset="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-4.jpg 800w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-4-300x140.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-4-768x358.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>b. Here is the 1-day CandlestickÂ  chart of PFC. So long the price was above the trendline, it remained in a range. However, once it pierced 121 and fell below the trendline, it went into a free fall. Today, it&#8217;s in the 80s, a 50% fall.</p>
<p>c. If the stock price does not violate the trendline support or resistance, it remains in a range/trend.</p>
<p>If prices remain above the downward sloping line it means the stock is in a bull trend and money is chasing the stock. But when it pierces the trendline, it implies that either bulls are tired or bears have taken over or there&#8217;s some adverse development in the market or in the company.</p>
<p>If prices remain below the downward sloping line it means the stock is in a bear trend and supply exceeds demand. But when it crosses the trendline upwards, it implies that either bears are tired or bulls have taken over or there&#8217;s some very favorable development in the market or in the company.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>VERY IMPORTANT: After the price breaks either side, up or down, do not jump into the stock. wait for one more confirmatory candle. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ALSO: Pay attention to the volumes. If the breakout is not supported by volumes, it can be a false positive.Â </strong></span></p>
<h3>WHO SHOULD USE TRENDLINES &#8211; INVESTOR OR TRADER?</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Trendlines tend to favor investors</strong></span>. Though some traders do use trendlines, the general rule is that trendlines favor short-long term investors.</p>
<h3>WHAT PERIOD TO USE WHILE DRAWING TRENDLINES?</h3>
<p>Investors should ideally use a 1-Day or 1-Month candlestick chart to draw trendlines.</p>
<p>Traders typically use 15-minute-to-30-minute candlestick chart on days of extreme fluctuations. But it works best for investors.</p>
<h3>HOW TO DRAW TRENDLINES?</h3>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-6.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1950" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-6.jpg" alt="TRENDLINES COACH TECHNICAL ANALYSIS" width="800" height="371" srcset="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-6.jpg 800w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-6-300x139.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-6-768x356.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>A. HOW TO DRAW DOWNWARD SLOPING TRENDLINE: </strong></p>
<p>You should join AT LEAST 2 candle wicks or candle bodies. My trendline touches about 5 candle wicks as you can see in the image above. This is the Tata Chemical chart. Once the stock price broke out of the trendline at 465, and was followed by a confirmatory candlestick, it flew all the way to 781.</p>
<p><strong>B. HOW TO DRAW UPWARD SLOPING TRENDLINE:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1951" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-7.jpg" alt="technical charts trendlines" width="800" height="371" srcset="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-7.jpg 800w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-7-300x139.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Trendline-tutorial-7-768x356.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s very similar to how you draw the downward sloping line.Â  In the example above (JaiPrakash Associates), you can see the price has violated the trendline at 23.90, and the violation accelerated the fall. However, you also will see that a bearish engulfing candle was formed on 8-8-17, when JPA was around 27.</p>
<p>The bearish engulfing candlestick is also a very potent sign of an impending fall.</p>

<p>Of course, you won&#8217;t.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://investorscarnival.com/speaker/ashwani-gujral/">So I took your unsolicited advice and borrowed the featured photo from this site.</a></strong></span></p>
<p>Okay, let&#8217;s start.</p>
<p>I know many investors do not like Ashwani Gujral and folks that listen to him are often impacted byÂ Verbal Dysdecorum<strong>. </strong>I also am assuming that such investors get hysterical and gooey slime often drips from their facial orifices.</p>
<p>For those who are unaware, Verbal Dysdecorum is an incredibly rare and strange brain disorder in which patients can&#8217;t censor themselves.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the right part of their brain goes defunct after entering into a couple of wrong trades suggested by his honor.</p>
<p>For those who are unaware, the right part of your brain controls your words and helps you appear as a decent human being, which apparently you are not. Heh, heh.</p>
<p>Anyway, let&#8217;s now really start.</p>
<p>Ashwani Gujral is an intra-hour trader and his understanding of macro and micro economic factors is unparalleled. He also is, asÂ  you already know, a brilliant technical analyst.</p>
<p>He may change his position during the day, like an Arab sheikh switches between wives, and this is one factor that many investors do not understand, making them abuse AG.</p>
<p>Here is how you can understand him:</p>
<p><strong>8.30 AM-8.59 AM COMMENTARY</strong></p>
<p>This is time when Ashwani is absolutely at his highest quality level. His understanding of the economy, the market setup, technical set up. Gems (not gems from Gitanjali) pour out from his lower facial cavity that is surrounded by the kissing muscle (mouth, in plain English).</p>
<p>This is the commentary you must absorb because it is the second most valuable bit of information you will get from Ashwani during the day. What&#8217;s the first? I&#8217;ll come to that.</p>
<p><strong>9.00 AM-9.15 AM COMMENTARY</strong></p>
<p>At this stage, Ashwani may have firmed up his mind about taking a trade and his commentary could be veered around that. He would be likely influenced by his reading of the market setup and to some extent by by what other analysts say.</p>
<p>Know that Ashwani&#8217;s position may change during the day depending on news and technicals, and therefore, if you are an investor, you should know that his advice is valid for the day, and perhaps for 1-2 hours if the market is all choppy like Bruce Lee.</p>
<p><strong>NIFTY-BANK NIFTY COMMENTARY DURING THE DAY</strong></p>
<p>His commentary on the market is again guided by his position and reading of the market situation (mostly by technicals). I can tell you with full confidence that his success ratio is 70%, which is damn good.</p>
<p><strong>CASH STOCKS COMMENTARY DURING THE DAY (NOT DAILY)</strong></p>
<p>There are occasions when Ashwani talks about cash stocks and says things such as &#8220;this stock is doing something special,&#8221; &#8220;this stock is now behaving like (another multibagger).&#8221;</p>
<p>These are the snippets you must latch on to.</p>
<p>You have no idea how I have benefited from Ashwani&#8217;s advice. I logged out of <strong>HCC</strong> at 45 because of his suggestion. I can vouch that he was among the first analysts to suggest stocks such as <strong>Tata Global</strong> (170-290), <strong>Hudco</strong> (70-100), <strong>Hind Copper</strong> (60-100), and many many more.</p>
<p>Know that such recos are not suggested daily. You may at most get 1-2 in a week, but for that you have to stay glued to CNBC latching on to Gujral&#8217;s every word.</p>
<p><strong>This is the commentary that no investor must miss. It&#8217;s pure gold!</strong></p>
<p>Despite not subscribing to AG&#8217;s service, I have benefited from his calls, and respect his knowledge and trading acumen. IMO, there is no other analyst that is so open and outspoken like him and though I tend to get irreverent sometimes, the respect for Ashwani Gujral will always remain.</p>

<p>Before you go any further, know this:</p>
<ol>
<li>I own some stock (disclosure).</li>
<li>Markets are copy and therefore the information in this post should be absorbed and the stock should be tracked.</li>
<li>In my opinion, the stock becomes attractive when it drops to 10-12 levels.</li>
<li>All the information in this post is based on a phone call to the Gujarat Poly Electronics office.</li>
</ol>
<p>REASONS WHY IT MAKES SENSE TO CONSIDER/ADD GUJARAT POLY ELECTRONICS TO YOUR PORTFOLIO</p>
<ol>
<li>The company belongs to the reputed Polychem group of companies. The promoter pedigree is good.</li>
<li>It was formed as a JV between AVX Electronics, USA &#8211; Polychem andÂ Gujarat Industrial Investment Corporation Limited (GIIC) ro manufacture single layer and multi layer capacitors.</li>
<li>Over time, the company was hit by competition by China and suffered losses.</li>
<li>The business was restructured and AVX Electronics exited the business in 2016-17. Their share was bought by Polychem.</li>
<li>In 2016-17, the company changed its strategy. It moved away from making the ordinary capacitors to value added capacitors (Radial Multi Layer Ceramic Capacitors) which are used in advanced applications like aerospace, telecommunications, defence, etc.</li>
<li>One of the key ingredient of the new strategy was that the company would not produce capacitor parts. INSTEAD, it would import parts from China and assemble these to create Radial MLCCs.</li>
<li>The company has since turned around and has started making modest profits. Turnover has increased in 2017-18 and the company should clock an EPS of about 75 paise for the year.</li>
<li>The installed capacity for manufacturing MLCCs is 20 crore MLCCs per annum. However, there is no limit to MLCCs that are assembled.</li>
<li>Radial MLCCs are priced between 35 paise and Rs 5 per piece, depending n their capacity. For the sake of approximation, let&#8217;s peg the average rate realized by Gujarat Poly Electronics at Rs 2.50 per MLCC.</li>
<li>Let us assume that 2 years down the line, the company assembles and sells 14 crore MLCCs (70% of capacity). Its turnover will shoot to 40 crores. 2017-18 turnover will close at about 15 crores.</li>
<li>The story does not stop here. The company has tied up with a MNC to distribute their products in India. The name was not shared, but I anticipate that these products would be high end parts that are used in manufacturing advanced electronics. The business potential of this new venture is not factored into the price.</li>
</ol>
<p>These inputs are based on my conversation with Mr Punyani who is based at the company&#8217;s HO in Ahmedabad. I picked up the stock after this conversation and tweeted about it. This blog post is FYI.</p>

<div id="attachment_1863" style="width: 653px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/HPCL-1-Day-Doji.gif"><img class="wp-image-1863 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/HPCL-1-Day-Doji.gif" alt="how to interpret the doji" width="643" height="563" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">In 2001, HPCL CMP ranged between 27 and 42. Late 2001, in the middle after getting hammered for a few days from 42 to 27 levels, a Doji (almost a Doji) with a longer bottom wick was formed. One day before this Doji , a red candle with a long bottom wick was formed. These Dojis indicated exhaustion of selling. The candle before that also indicated the same thing. In fact, we can say that at 27, the selling in HPCl was completely exhausted, and therefore HPCL was a buy. You can see from the subsequent price movements how HPCL shot up and returned handsome gains to traders.</p></div>
<p>The Doji-in-a-bear-phase can also be used by intraday traders by adjusting the candlestick time periods in their charts. 15-minute Candles for those who trade several times in a day or 1 hour Candles for those who trade no more than 1-2 times in a day.</p>
<h5>HOW TO TRADE THE DOJI IN A BEAR MARKET</h5>
<ol>
<li><strong>Watch from the sidelines</strong></li>
<li><strong>Invest 10%-20% of your allocation for that stock and watch subsequent candles</strong></li>
<li><strong>Consider it as a reversal signal and stand by to act based on subsequent charts and price action</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>2: DOJI IN A BULL MARKET</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s check out Reliance Power&#8217;s 1-day chart to help understand the importance of a Doji in a bull market.</p>
<div id="attachment_1879" style="width: 668px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rpOWER.gif"><img class="wp-image-1879 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rpOWER.gif" alt="Doji and bearish engulfing explained" width="658" height="617" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">On 2-1-18, Reliance Power, which was in a bull market, hit a high of around 65. Thereafter it dithered a bit and slowed down to 55 levels. It jumped again, but on 5-1-18, it formed a Doji and closed at about 58-59 levels. This Doji in a robust bull market is a sign of bull tiredness/trend reversal. Though it jumped up to 61 levels, a subsequent bearish engulfing candle confirmed bearishness in the counter. The Bearish Engulfing candle formation is explained below.</p></div>
<h5>HOW TO TRADE THE DOJI IN A BULL MARKET</h5>
<ol>
<li><strong>Book 40%-50% of your holding in that stock and watch subsequent candles</strong></li>
<li><strong>Consider it as a reversal signal and stand by to act based on subsequent charts and price action</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>3: BEARISH ENGULFING CANDLE</h3>
<p>In theory,Â a bearish engulfing candle&#8217;s price first tests the previous day&#8217;s high, and then sellers hammer it and drag it below the the previous dayâ€™s low.</p>
<p>On charts, a bearish engulfing candle completely covers the prior candle. Let&#8217;s check this chart out:</p>
<div id="attachment_1880" style="width: 666px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rpower-bearish-engulfing.gif"><img class="wp-image-1880 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rpower-bearish-engulfing.gif" alt="how to trade bearish engulfing candle" width="656" height="578" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">On 9-1-18, Reliance Power crossed the previous day&#8217;s high and tested 62.25, higher than the previous day&#8217;s high. It then met with a wave of selling and closed at 57 levels, lower than the previous day&#8217;s low. A red candle was formed which covered the previous day&#8217;s green candle.</p></div>
<h5>HOW TO TRADE THE BEARISH ENGULFING CANDLESTICK</h5>
<ol>
<li><strong>If the general market trend is bullish, and you are making handsome profits, sell 40%-50% of your holding and watch subsequent candles. The candle can also be used to book losses or shorting, depending on your investment strategy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If the market trend is bearish, book profits and hold on to free shares so long the stock is high quality.Â  Can book losses too. Can try shorting as well.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>4: BULLISH ENGULFING CANDLE</h3>
<p>In theory,Â a bullish engulfing candle&#8217;s formed when the price of a stock moves above the high and low price of the previous day&#8217;s candle.</p>
<p>On charts, a bullish engulfing candle completely covers the prior candle. Let&#8217;s check this chart out:</p>
<div id="attachment_1884" style="width: 551px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rpower-bullish-engulfing.gif"><img class="wp-image-1884 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rpower-bullish-engulfing.gif" alt="understanding bullish engulfing candles" width="541" height="536" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">On 18-12-17, Reliance Power formed a bullish engulfing candle as you can see in the chart (second encircled candle). At that time, Rpower was hovering around 36 levels, and from here on, it started zooming, and did not stop till it touched 65, and then the trend reversed following a bearish engulfing candle (see explanation above).</p></div>
<h5>HOW TO TRADE THE BULLISH ENGULFING CANDLESTICK</h5>
<ol>
<li><strong>This is a buy signal in any market so long the candle is supported by rising volumes. However, in a bear or choppy market, you should ideally validate it by checking MACD and RSI.Â </strong></li>
<li><strong>If the market trend is bearish, book profits and hold on to free shares so long the stock is high quality.Â  Can book losses too. Can try shorting as well.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>5: GREEN MARBOZU</h3>
<p>A green Marbozu is a full bodied green-colored candle (no wicks). It&#8217;s an extremely bullish signal in any market.</p>
<div id="attachment_1885" style="width: 551px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/aries-marbozu.gif"><img class="wp-image-1885 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/aries-marbozu.gif" alt="how to interpret marubozu candle" width="541" height="536" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">On 16-10-17, Aries Agro opened at 172 and closed at 206, forming a green marubozu. Typically, investors would not have bought it, feeling the stock had appreciated like crazy. However, had they checked the charts and seen the Marubozu, they would have bought. Aries Agro went on to hit 260+ levels where it encountered several powerful bearish candles, and slipped to 213.</p></div>
<h5>HOW TO TRADE THE GREEN MARUBOZU</h5>

<li><strong>This is a buy signal in any market so long the candle is supported by rising volumes. </strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>6: RED MARUBOZU</h3>
<p>A red Marubozu is a full bodied red-colored candle (no wicks). It&#8217;s an extremely bearish signal in any market. It&#8217;s very difficult to find a red marubozu in a bull market for a prominent stock. But I&#8217;ve something that&#8217;s close to one.</p>
<div id="attachment_1886" style="width: 551px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fortis-red-marubozu.gif"><img class="wp-image-1886 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fortis-red-marubozu.gif" alt="how to analyze bearish marubozu" width="541" height="536" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">On 22-5-17 Fortis hit 206 and crashed against a wave of selling. It closed at 195. Its candle was bearish engulfing, and looked like an almost-Marubozu. It was a powerful sell signal, but I can bet that many investors would have waited because they loved ts business model. Well, the story is there for all to see. Fortis crashed to 109 on 5-2-18.</p></div>
<h5>HOW TO TRADE THE RED MARUBOZU</h5>
<ol>
<li><strong>This is a SELL signal in any market so long the candle is supported by above-average volumes.</strong></li>
