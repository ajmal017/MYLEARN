<p>I&#8217;ve taken a jewelry company as a case study because it will help you catch the areas that need to be focused on.</p>
<p>However, this article is not just about that company  &#8211; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the goal of this post is to inform you that it is COMPULSORY to read the Annual Report (AR) before buying a stock.</strong></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve correlated different finance heads and applied common sense, because it is all boils down to common sense and a very basic understanding of business.</p>
<p>Here are some areas that seemed glaringly out of the place:</p>
<h2>SHORT TERM LIQUIDITY</h2>
<p>Any company must have the capacity to meet short-term obligations.</p>
<p>If the company does not have enough liquid assets to pay short term liabilities, it shows inefficient cash management.</p>
<p>(Cash + Investments + Debtors)  which are liquid assets, must exceed Current Liabilities (trade payables, short term borrowings and other current liabilities that are payable)</p>
<p>Inventories do not count because selling these will seriously impair its business.</p>
<p>Also, if at all it has to sell inventory then it will take time and huge losses because no one will buy stock in trade at market rates.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s take a look at this company&#8217;s short term liquidity:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/QR.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2645 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/QR.jpg" alt="quick ratio explained with examples" width="616" height="542" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/QR.jpg 616w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/QR-300x264.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Investments + Debtors + Cash/Bank + Other Liquid assets = </b><b>2511 </b><b>crores</b></p>
<p><b>Short term borrowing + Creditors + other short term liabilities = </b><b>3785 </b><b>crores</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>So if there’s a run on this company, it would have been </b><b>short 1274 </b></span><b><span style="color: #ff0000;">crores</span>.</b></p>
<p>There are comments below that gold could be sold to meet the shortfall. But if the company starts selling its gold, it won&#8217;t get the market price and would incur a loss. Moreover it would jeopardize their business and the brand name.</p>
<h2>INTEREST ON BORROWINGS</h2>
<p>Typically a company obtains long term loans to invest in capital assets and short term loans to finance the working capital.</p>
<p>The interest on long term loans is lower than the interest on short term loans. Given the present day interest regime (mid 2018), the rate of interest would work up to a maximum of about 13%.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s now check how much this company has paid:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings3.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2649 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings3.jpg" alt="interest analysis" width="596" height="290" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings3.jpg 596w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings3-300x146.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /></a></p>
<p>It has paid 274 crores on account of interest. Now let&#8217;s check its loans:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2648" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings.jpg" alt="pc jewellers borrowings loans" width="596" height="290" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings.jpg 596w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings-300x146.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /></a></p>
<p>It has obtained loans of Rs 634 crores.</p>
<p><b>Interest Paid for the year = </b><b>275 </b><b>crores on loan of 634 crores. </b></p>
<p><u><b>Works out to a 43.35% rate of interest. Looks abnormal.</b></u></p>
<p>There were tweets that the company takes gold on lease instead of buying stock. And then someone tweeted that jewelry company take gold leases and therefore let&#8217;s explore that angle as well:</p>
<p>So let us work out how much the company took gold on lease.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/revival-of-gold-on-lease-to-benefit-titan-pc-jewellers-more-115021900888_1.html">Many companies take gold on lease from banks and the rate of interest is about 5% to 8%</a>.</p>
<p>Standalone sales are 8105 crores. Exports make up 34%.</p>
<p>Cost of goods sold is 7400 crores. It is not specified in this account head how much represents making charges, and how much are purchases of gold.</p>
<p>Now, making is a value add activity and it should result in a higher profit margin. But if you correlate the cost of goods sold to the sales, we get a margin of 9% on standalone basis. Therefore, it can be safe to assume that the the cost of goods sold includes purchases of gold and diamonds.</p>
<p>Now, in a gold lease, the bank leases gold to the jewelry maker and in turn the jewelry maker has to secure the bank with some collateral that covers the cost of the gold.</p>
<p>Now let us assume that this company took gold on lease and it was shown in the inventory (asset).</p>
<p>Will it not be safe to assume that the bank demanded a collateral and the company created some charge on FDs or some other assets?</p>
<p>It will be safe to make this assumption.  Let&#8217;s look at the companies assets (standalone) (no major divergences in consolidated figures).</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pcj007.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2658 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pcj007.jpg" alt="assets analysis" width="929" height="602" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pcj007.jpg 929w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pcj007-300x194.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pcj007-768x498.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px" /></a></p>
<p>Which asset could have been pledged against the gold leases?</p>
<p>The investments represent investment in a subsidiary &#8211; THIS CANNOT BE PLEDGED</p>
<p>The loans represent loans to related parties &#8211; THESE CANNOT BE PLEDGED</p>
<p>Deferred assets, trade receivables, loans CANNOT BE PLEDGED.</p>
<p>Other assets represent mostly prepaid expenses &#8211; CANNOT BE PLEDGED</p>
<p>Inventories are assumed to have been taken on lease &#8211; CANNOT BE PLEDGED</p>
<p>Cash is required for the business &#8211; CANNOT BE PLEDGED</p>
<p>Bank Balance is 555 crores and is represented by deposits below 3 months. This CAN BE PLEDGED.</p>
<p>Therefore I am assuming that 555 crores or thereabouts is the value of the gold leases and assuming the highest rate of interest @ 8%, which is 44 crores.</p>
<p>THEREFORE THE TOTAL INTEREST PAID CAN BE ABOUT 10% ON 634 CRORE (LOANS) <strong>plus </strong>THE ASSUMED INTEREST ON GOLD LEASES OF 44 CRORES.</p>
<p>Note that though gold leases are for a short period, I am assuming the company kept rolling over gold leases and obtained 555 crores for 1 year and paid the highest rate of interest.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Therefore the total interest that I can assume is about Rs 107 crores while the interest provided is Rs 274 crores. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Even if you assume 1% LC charges on exports booked as interest, we can add another 27 crores to the interest taking it to 134 crores, while the interest paid is 274 crores. </strong></span></p>
<p><b>INFERENCE: OBVIOUSLY THERE IS SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT ADD UP.</b></p>
<h2>INVENTORY LEVELS</h2>
<p>Sales for the YE 31.3.17 are 8104 crores</p>
<p>The cost of sales is 7409 crores, which implies that this company makes about 9% gross profit margin.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2650" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory.jpg" alt="what is inventory ratio" width="611" height="317" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory.jpg 611w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory-300x156.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" /></a></p>
<p>Inventory as on 31-3-17 is 4119 crores. Let us add 9% and reconcile it with the selling rate. We get inventory at 4526 crores at market prices.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2651 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory-2.jpg" alt="why is inventory to turnover ratio important" width="611" height="228" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory-2.jpg 611w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory-2-300x112.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" /></a></p>
<p>Every company holds inventory in the hope of selling it quickly and turning around the cash with which it can do more business.</p>
<p>Heavy inventories are a sign of inefficient inventory management.</p>
<p>In the case of this company, the inventory held represents 6.5 months of sale. This is an extraordinarily high level of inventory and a sign that inventory management needs to sharpen up .</p>
<p><b>Remember that high value inventory like jewelry and diamonds are surrounded by negative factors such as high storage costs,  fear of theft, interest to pay, etc.</b></p>
<p>Clearly, the 6.5 months of inventory seems high.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>There is a comment below that you need this kind of inventory in the jewelry business.</strong> </span></p>
<p>Let us take the case of <strong>Titan</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Sales 12717 crores</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inventory 4807 crores</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s 4.5 months of inventory for 640+ jewelry and Fasttrack stores. The company in this example has 75 stores and remember, 34% of its products are exported.  <strong>Titan</strong> too exports but I don&#8217;t have the percentage at this moment.</p>
<p>In any case, I do feel that in the Jewelry business an inventory of 4.5 to 5 months is acceptable. Anything over that suggests that operations must be optimized.</p>
<h2>MARKET CAPITALIZATION TO TOTAL LIABILITIES</h2>
<p>Actually, this  check wouldn&#8217;t have applied last year when the this company&#8217;s AR was released and its its stock price was very high that time.</p>
<p>However, you should apply it to all companies in the news for the wrong reasons to get a understanding of what would happen to them if there&#8217;s a run on their finances.</p>
<p><b>The current market cap of this company = 2450 </b><b>crores</b><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>Total  Liabilities = 3850 </b><b>crores</b><b><br />
(excl </b><b>equity</b><b> cap + reserves)</b></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mcap.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2654" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mcap.jpg" alt="mcap to total liabilities" width="592" height="317" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mcap.jpg 592w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mcap-300x161.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /></a></p>
<p><b>INFERENCE: There&#8217;s a shortfall of 1400 crores, which means that the confidence of investors in this company&#8217;s assets is not high. This correlation shows how much the company&#8217;s assets can possibly decline in value in case there&#8217;s a run on it.</b></p>
<h2>CASH FLOW</h2>
<p>By now you would have realized that this company was holding very high inventory levels, paying a high rate of interest and its short term liquidity was not good.</p>
<p>What should this company do in such circumstances?</p>
<p>Use cash for optimizing operations, wiping off debt, etc.</p>
<p>Therefore let&#8217;s check the company&#8217;s cash flow statement.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cash-flow.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2655 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cash-flow.jpg" alt="cash flow" width="610" height="526" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cash-flow.jpg 610w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cash-flow-300x259.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></a></p>
<p><b>The company has invested in a subsidiary and handed over a loan to a group company, both transactions amounting to 293 </b><b>crores, and it ended up taking a new loan (net) of </b><b> </b><b>1</b><b>80 </b><b>crores to fund the transactions.</b></p>
<p><b>INFERENCE: Cash management does not meet accepted norms.</b></p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>Would you have invested in this company last year when it was peaking even after analyzing this information?</p>
<p>Of course, you wouldn&#8217;t have.</p>
<h2>So, this post is not to take you into the past and give you lectures about any company. The objective of this post is to make you understand that it is extremely important to read and analyze Annual Reports before making an investment.</h2>

<p>Remember that nothing is sacrosanct and things keep changing over time.</p>
<p>The Financial Risk Calculator is based on Altman&#8217;s Z-Score.</p>
<p><strong>The score does not hold good for turnaround companies, and it may even represent a skewed picture for established companies.</strong></p>
<p>ALSO: This article is not valid for turnaround companies.</p>
<p>However, each line item of the Score has a story to tell, and here is how you should extrapolate one item with the other to interpret the story.</p>
<p><strong>1. WORKING CAPITAL TO TOTAL ASSETS</strong></p>
<p>A high working capital to assets ratio can actually be a negative because it can imply any of the following:</p>
<p>a. The management does not know how to deploy its cash.</p>
<p>b. The company holds excess and possibly obsolete inventory.</p>
<p>c. The company may have loads of bad debts that are reported in the receivables.</p>
<p>Also, a very low working capital to total assets ratio need not be a negative. It can imply that the company enjoys extended credit facilities from its suppliers.</p>
<p><strong>2. RESERVES &amp; SURPLUS TO TOTAL ASSETS</strong></p>
<p>When a company has low reserves, it can only expand or maybe even fulfill working capital requirements by borrowing more.</p>
<p>Sch companies can avoided because any disruption in the market or the entry of stronger competitors can destabilized business.</p>
<p><strong>3. EBIT To TOTAL ASSETS</strong></p>
<p>This is like the return on assets ratio. Think about it, if you have made a FD, you can easily make up to 7% in interest.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can ratio to figure out whether the company is returning a healthy return.</p>
<p>If the company&#8217;s rate of return on its assets is sub par or below its peers, you can junk it and switch over to a better stock.</p>
<p><strong>3. MARKET CAP To TOTAL LIABILITIES</strong></p>
<p>Let us understand the importance of this relationship with a real example: PC Jewellers</p>
<p>Market Cap of PC Jewellers is 7416 crores</p>
<p>Total Liabilities are 3790 crores</p>
<p>This gives us a ratio of 1.95 when PCJ is at 193.</p>
<p>When PC Jewellers fell to 98 bucks, this ratio would have been reduced to 1.00.</p>
<p>Now think what will happen if there is a run on PC Jewelers&#8217; shares. It&#8217;s non current assets are just 558 crores and its current assets are a whopping 6900 crores.</p>
<p>If there is a run on the share, the liabilities will outstrip market capitalization, creditors will start knocking for payments while debtors may do the vanishing act.</p>
<p>Long story short, avoid companies that have a low  Mcap to Total Liabilities ratio.</p>
<p>These notes will help you fine tune your understanding of the Financial Risk Calculator.</p>

<p>One off or unusual transactions often create fluctuations in financial relationships between different items, and help the researcher figure out fraud.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get down to what you must analyze:</p>
<h2>Assets to Liabilities Ratio</h2>
<p>When a company starts operations, it usually starts with the promoters contributing to equity. Then it also takes a loan to meet its long or short term commitments, and with the money in hand, it buys assets and starts operations.</p>
<p>Over time, it starts making profits and building on its assets (either physical or liquid) and after some years it is naturally expected that its assets will far exceed its liabilities.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take an Example of Hikal Ltd., as on 31-3-17.</p>
<p>The equity is 16.44 crores, reserves are 605 crores, non-current and current liabilities work up to 746 crores. Of these liabilities, only the 746 crores are payable.</p>
<p>The total assets (fixed, current) work up to 1367 crores.</p>
<p>Therefore 1367/746 = 1.83, implying that assets comfortably exceed liabilities.</p>
<p>This is the first check you must perform. Remember that if this year&#8217;s assets-to-liability ratio shows a heavy fluctuation over last year&#8217;s it implies something is wrong.</p>
<p>For example, if prior year&#8217;s assets-to-liabilities ratio was 0.50 and if this year&#8217;s ratio is 0.75, it implies</p>
<p>a. Company is financing business by borrowing and does not have sufficient equity (bad sign)</p>
<p>b. Liabilities were reduced by generating operational cash flows or equity, or additional assets were bought by raising equity. If there is no valid explanation for this wild fluctuation, it implies something is wrong or the management is hiding something.</p>
<h2>Relationship Between Sales, Debtors and Inventories</h2>
<p>Some companies who want to jack up their stock prices or entice lenders/investors, often sell their products to their group companies or their friend&#8217;s companies.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>Goods are sold on credit to known parties.</li>
<li>This jacks up sales and debtors.</li>
<li>The payment is not made and the goods are returned in the next accounting period.</li>
<li>The lenders and shareholders get taken in by the increased sales and it is possible tat many act impulsively.</li>
</ol>
<p>To understand if a financial scam is going on, here&#8217;s what you should compare:</p>
<p><strong>a. DEBTORS TO SALES:</strong></p>
<p>Let us understand this ration by citing an example:</p>
<p>If sales were 1,00,000 last year and debtors worked up to 10,000, it implied that debtors were 10% of sales and the company sold Rs 8,333 on an average per month.</p>
<p>This implies the company offers a credit period of maximum 35-40 days to its debtors.</p>
<p>Now, if in the current year, sales rise to 1,50,000 and debtors jump to 30,000, it implies that the debtors to sales percentage have increased from 10% to 20%.</p>
<p>Let us check the credit period now. If the company sold 1,50,000 per year, then it sold 12,500 per month.</p>
<p>The debtors jumped to 30,000, implying the credit period jumped to about 72 days. We have a jump in credit period of more than a month (from 35-40 days to 72 days) and a doubling of the percentage growth in debtors. This requires investigation and it is likely you will unearth something fishy.</p>
<p><strong>b. INVENTORIES TO SALES:</strong></p>
<p>The ratio compares the inventories held by the company to the sales. To understand it, let&#8217;s take an example:</p>
<p>If sales were 1,00,000 last year and inventories worked up to 15,000, it implied that inventories were 15% of sales and assuming the company sold Rs 8,333 on an average per month.</p>
<p>Note that inventories are valued at cost, and therefore assuming a GP margin of 20%, let us say that the market value of inventories is 18,000. The adjusted inventories to sales percentage is 18%.</p>
<p>These numbers imply that the company carries inventories for a  maximum 66 days (18000/8333).</p>
<p>Now, if in the current year, sales rise to 1,50,000 and inventories jump to 30,000 (market value 36,000), it implies that the inventories to sales percentage has increased from 18% to 24% (adjusted) (36000/150000).</p>
<p>It also implies that the inventory holding period also has jumped to about 85 days (36000/12500).</p>
<p>So the inventory holding percentage has jumped from 18% to 24% and the inventory holding days from 66 to 85.</p>
<p>Now, excess inventories and debtors can also result because of a recession or government policy (demonetization, GST), and if these are not the cause then the increase in inventory holding implies that either the product is outdated (technological obsolescence, or past expiry date) and may be therefore unsaleable.</p>
<p>These checks will help you unearth some red flags that can be because of financial jugglery.</p>
<h2>Quick Ratio</h2>
<p>Though this ratio is a simple calculation, it can help you figure out financial window dressing.</p>
<p>Quick Ratio divides the liquid assets (debtors, cash, investments, loans) with current liabilities (which can be made payable on demand).</p>
<p>QR = Debtors + Cash + Investments/Current Liabilities</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take an example:</p>
<p>If a company&#8217;s quick ratio is 3 in the past year and 1.5 in the current year, it implies that either the numerator has decreased and/or the denominator has increased.</p>
<p>So if the numerator has decreased, it implies debtors, investments and cash balances have reduced. This could be because of bad debts or a downtrend in the economy or because of excessive competitive pressure. The decline needs to be investigated.</p>
<p>If the numerator has increased, the cash flows should also increase in tandem. If not, then it is possible that some window dressing is going on.</p>
<p>If the denominator has increased, it means current liabilities (mainly made up of trade payables) have ballooned. Has the production increased? If the production has increased, the sales should increase? If not, why not? Once you get into the current liabilities you should correlate it with sales, cost of production, inventories and try to figure out why the company obtained more stocks on credit.</p>
<p>If the denominator has decreased, it could mean that the company is not getting orders and has therefore stopped buying material. It could imply obsolescence of the product line. Or it could mean that the company used up a lot of its cash flows in paying off trade payables. This too must be investigated because it is possible the company bought from a group firm and was in a hurry to pay it off so that some cash was exchanged with the promoters.</p>
<h2>Net Profit Margins</h2>
<p>When the Net Profit (before tax) is expressed as a percentage of sales, it shows how efficient the company in the line of business.</p>
<p>Let us take a common businessman&#8217;s example: If he makes 1,00,000 profits on sales of 8,00,000 and pays no tax, it implies his net profit margin is 12.5%. Naturally, every person wants to grow his income and therefore this businessman will try to increase his sales and net profit margin going forward. The same should be expected from a company.</p>
<p>So, how does the net profit margins uncover a financial scam?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take an example:</p>
<p><strong>Year 1:</strong></p>
<p>Sales: 1,00,000<br />
Total Expenses: 80,000<br />
Net profit: 20,000<br />
Net profit margin: 20%</p>
<p><strong>Year 2:</strong></p>
<p>Sales: 1,50,000<br />
Total Expenses: 1,35,000<br />
Net profit: 15,000<br />
Net profit margin: 1o%</p>
<p>In the example above, revenue increased 50%, but cost increased 54% pulling down the net profit margins from 20% to 10%.</p>
<p>What could be the reasons for the increase in the expenses?:</p>
<p>a. Are expenses (sales, raw materials) overstated?</p>
<p>b. Have any new and unusual expenses been incurred?</p>
<p>c. (In case net profit margin has abnormally increased) Are sales overstated, or expenses understated?</p>
<h2>Debt and Interest Cover Ratios</h2>
<p>Think about it &#8211; if your own about 1 crore worth of assets, how much would you borrow to set up a business?</p>
<p>You&#8217;d ensure that you&#8217;d borrow up to a maximum of Rs 1 crore so as to ensure you can pay up the interest and repay the loan in case your business goes bust. But no more.</p>
<p>The same applies to companies. If the companies equity is 1 crore then the best case scenario is that it has no debt, a good case if it&#8217;s debt is 50% of equity, an okay case if the debt is 100% of equity. Things start getting worse after the debt crosses 200% of equity. Look what happened to Rcom, JP Associates, Bhushan Steel, etc., when they chose to borrow more than could afford.</p>
<p>You can check debt: equity ratio by dividing Debt by (Equity+Reserves).</p>
<p><strong>The Interest cover</strong> is extremely important as well. Banking norms require companies to maintain the EBITDA/Interest cover at a minimum of 2.0. That means a company&#8217;s earnings before interest, depreciation and taxes should be at least 2 times the interest it pays on loans. Anything less than that is a red flag.</p>
<p>Sometimes promoters obtain loans and divert it for their personal use or spend it it on non-revenue items and these ratios catch the tiger by its tail.</p>
<h2>Sales Growth</h2>
<p>Every company grows over time. Typically for a good company, sales growth  easily exceeds the inflation rate. But the growth is more or less consistent unless there&#8217;s a major disruption such as global shortage of product leading to massive price spikes (HEG, Graphite), production facilities shutting down across the world, etc. When events like these occur, sales growth spikes abnormally.</p>
<p>On the flipside, negative disruptions such as demonetization and a flawed tax structure (GST) can make growth fall dramatically.</p>
<p>Point is that besides disruptions, there is little else to impact sales growth.</p>
<p>Now, companies that are desirous of showing higher sales growth for whatever reason above the normal, often resort to financial jugglery.</p>
<p>You should check the year-on-year sales growth of any company and if you find any abnormal spike that is unexplained, you should start digging deeper (which you can catch using the techniques above).</p>
<p>Besides these techniques, BullBull wwill publish a tool that will help you determine the risk profile of any company. Stay tuned for that.</p>

<p>Well, the truth is that most of us do not have the inclination or patience to be a value investor. Let&#8217;s face it &#8211; we are all greedy and will jump in at the slightest opportunity based on how we feel or hear.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not what a value investor does.</p>
<p><strong>A value investor is a cold, thinking and heartless investor who will wait patiently for stocks to get underpriced, and he also will wait patiently and track the stock he owns until it achieves its full potential.</strong></p>
<p>The key to value investing therefore is to buy an underpriced stock, hold it patiently and keep tracking its performance (of course, a value investor does sell out if the company&#8217;s performance does not meet</p>
<p>Here are the moves that a value investor makes, and if you make the same moves without succumbing to the wiles of the market, it will do you a world of good.</p>
<h3>INTRINSIC VALUE CALCULATION</h3>
<p>In simple terms, the intrinsic value of a stock can be said to be the actual value of a company based on its long term projections.</p>
<p>The idea is to buy the stock if it is available at a significant discount to its intrinsic value. It is arrived at by estimating the growth rate of a company in the long run and then applying that growth rate to the current EPS.</p>
<p>Intrinsic value is calculated based on a formula that extrapolates the near and long term growth rates of a company and applies the calculation to the current EPS.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/intrinsic-value-calculator/"><strong>You can always use the Intrinsic Value Calculator here.</strong></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example. I calculated the Intrinsic Value of Gujarat Pipavav and found that it works up to 293, assuming current EPS of 4, near term growth rate of 5% for the next 5 years, which climbs to 7% thereafter. The probability of this coming true was set at 75%.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/intrinsic-value.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2029" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/intrinsic-value.jpg" alt="intrinsic value calculator" width="611" height="442" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/intrinsic-value.jpg 611w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/intrinsic-value-300x217.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" /></a></p>
<p>The Intrinsic value based on these numbers worked out to 293. The CMP is 142. So, my rule of thumb says that for the long term the gain % does not appear attractive, and therefor this stock does not make a value buy at the moment.</p>
<h3>MARGIN OF SAFETY CALCULATION</h3>
<p>The margin of safety concept is a fancy one. In plain English, the margin of safety is the discount percentage you are getting on the stock.</p>
<p>For example, in Gujarat Pipavav&#8217;s case, the CMP is 45% of the intrinsic value, so your discount on intrinsic value is about 55%.</p>
<p>You can look at the margin or safety by any angle you are comfortable with. For example,</p>
<p>You may consider anything over 3x BV as expensive, or you can consider 20+PE as expensive &#8211; it all depends on your calculation.</p>
<h3>DISRUPTION</h3>
<p>Some of the age old principles of value investing no longer apply in today&#8217;s world. If you have noticed, our world is rapidly changing. Electric vehicles, e-learning work-at-home, paperless economy, plant meats, 3D printers, insolvency processes, protectionism, etc., are reshaping the way we live and do business.</p>
<p>Every value investor must therefore MUST keep on top of disruption. If he finds that his company cannot keep on top of disruption, he must hawk his stock.</p>
<h3>UNFOLLOW THE HERD?</h3>
<p>Traditional value investors in the Warren Buffett mould do not chase what the herd is missing. They go for relatively unfancied stocks that have potential to grow.</p>
<p>In the bargain, these idiot traditional value investors missing out investing in multibaggers such as Google and Amazon.</p>
<p>So, if you want to be a modern value investor, you must look at everything and chase a business that has a solid business model that is available at a discount.</p>
<h3>RIP VAN WINKLE INVESTING</h3>
<p>The traditional model of value investing is to buy a quality stock at a discount and hold it for several years. Of course, you should track it.</p>
<p>Well, this does hold true. However, if you are a trader or someone who makes a living off the markets, then you cannot be expected to be patient.</p>
<p>Think about this &#8211; top value investors say that even if your stock appreciates 60%-70% in as little as 3-4 months, don&#8217;t sell it. Keep holding.</p>
<p>So, if you are are prepared be a Rip van Winkle to your stocks, value investing is for you.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all there is to know. Thanks for dropping by and reading this piece.</p>

<h3>Here is a practical lesson on how to predict commodity cycles.</h3>
<h1><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Example</strong>: Copper</span></h1>
<h2><strong>STEP 1</strong>: Access Historical Charts</h2>
<p>I Googled &#8220;Copper Price Historical Chart,&#8221; and landed on this <a href="http://www.macrotrends.net/1476/copper-prices-historical-chart-data"><strong>45 year chart</strong>.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Copper-historical-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1991" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Copper-historical-1.jpg" alt="predict copper super cycle" width="768" height="582" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Copper-historical-1.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Copper-historical-1-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>The recessionary periods are represented by vertical gray bars. As you can see that the prices of copper started spiking from 2003-04 onwards, crashed after the 2008 bust and then picked up from 2010. Volumes also have picked up from 2010 on, and the copper price spiked to $4.50 (per lb) by 2013-14, and then subsequently corrected. Thereafter it resumed its upward march and is currently at around $3.05 with support at $1.50 and resistance at $4.50. As you can see, the volumes have picked up in recent years, which is a bullish signal.</p>
<h2><strong>STEP </strong>2: Search For The Commodity&#8217;s Global Global Demand in the Near Future</h2>
<p>The next step was to figure out how copper demand will pan out in the near future. I Googled &#8220;global copper demand 2020&#8221; and landed on a <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://minerals.statedevelopment.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/294631/Copper_to_the_World_Vanessa_Davidson_Keynote_address_27_June_2017.pdf">mid-2017 document that discussed about the global copper demand and supply.</a></span></strong></p>
<p><em>(You can get authoritative documents for any commodity so long you know how to search intelligently on Google.)</em></p>
<p>In this document I learned that:</p>
<p>a. Substantial capacities were added between 2011-16 and that capacities were not expected to increase much between 2017-2021.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-capacities-2020.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1993" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-capacities-2020.jpg" alt="copper mine capacity 2020" width="1097" height="592" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-capacities-2020.jpg 1097w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-capacities-2020-300x162.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-capacities-2020-768x414.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-capacities-2020-1024x553.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1097px) 100vw, 1097px" /></a></p>
<p>b. That demand will outstrip supply as we head towards 2020, a factor that will push prices higher.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-supply-demand-2020.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1995" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-supply-demand-2020.jpg" alt="Copper demand-supply scenario" width="1291" height="596" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-supply-demand-2020.jpg 1291w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-supply-demand-2020-300x138.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-supply-demand-2020-768x355.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-supply-demand-2020-1024x473.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1291px) 100vw, 1291px" /></a></p>
<p>c. That no substantial investment in copper mines is expected so long prices do not rise dramatically.</p>
<p>d. Prices are expected to rise faster than costs, resulting in better margins.</p>
<p>e. That the supply of copper scrap increased substantially, a factor that helped keep prices in check despite demand spiking up.</p>
<p>f. That China&#8217;s industrialization cycle may end by 2026, a factor that will ensure that copper prices do not spike up. In fact, it is expected that copper prices will remain steady after 2026 or taper off.</p>
<h2><strong>STEP 3</strong>: Search for the Commodity&#8217;s Uses</h2>
<div>Googling &#8220;uses of copper&#8221; helped me discover that copper is used in the following applications:</div>
<div></div>
<div>a. Electrical equipment because it conducts heats and electricity efficiently.</div>
<div>b. Construction (plumbing, roofing, etc.)</div>
<div>c. Industrial machinery</div>
<div>d. Water purification</div>
<div>e. As a poison in agriculture (copper sulfate)</div>
<div>f. Other minor applications such as detecting sugar.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The biggest takeway from these uses was that the boom in electric vehicles and technology (advanced electronics that may trigger technological obsolescence) will drive demand for copper going forward.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="https://www.copper.org/education/history/us-history/g_fact_future.html"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>I also Googled &#8220;future uses of copper,</strong></span>&#8220;</a> and learned that copper will be used in the following applications that have potential in the future:</div>
<div></div>
<div>a. Solar energy</div>
<div>b. Earth-coupled heat pumps</div>
<div>c. Electric Vehicles</div>
<div>d. Electronics (as usual)</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<h2><strong>STEP 4</strong>: Global Disruptions</h2>
<p>The world is now cruising uncomfortably on rocking terrain. America has triggered a global trade war, countries are resorting to protectionism, and there are geopolitical tensions (N Korea-USA, Israel-Iran).</p>
<p>Any escalation of any one situation can lead to a drop in commodity prices (except precious metals).</p>
<h2><strong>STEP 5</strong>: Weigh the Bullish and Bearish Factors</h2>

<table id="tablepress-21" class="tablepress tablepress-id-21">

<tr class="row-1 odd">

<h2><strong>STEP 6</strong>: Analysis</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p> Though demand of copper outstrips supply at the moment, the increased supply of copper scrap and the possibility of capacities getting commissioned have kept prices in check. Nevertheless, the demand for copper will increase as EVs and solar energy applications worm their way into daily life.</p>
<p>At this moment, it will be safe to say that there is nothing majorly bullish about copper because if prices spike up, new capacities will be added very quickly, and existing production disruptions also will get set right, leading to a correction.</p>
<p>Therefore, as things stand, with the possibility of trade wars upon us, we can assume that copper will be range bound with support at $1.50 and resistance at $4.50. Anything over $4 or so will make new capacities kick in.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
</div>
<div> Well, this is more or less it. You can try this method for any commodity and check how it works. You also can dig deeper by Googling for terms such as</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;why is  (commodity&#8217;s) supply disrupted&#8221;</div>
<div>&#8220;seasonal factors that impact (commodity&#8217;s) production (or, demand).&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Good luck, and drop in a line if you found this article helpful.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PS: If I were you, I&#8217;d buy a quality copper scrap recycling stock and hold it for 3 years. It will become a sure multibagger.</strong></span></div>

Is it priced right? What is the target price?"></a></p><h4>Many investors pose the following questions to analysts, researchers and TV Channel experts:</h4>
<p>1. What&#8217;s your view on this stock?<br />
2. Should I hold on to this stock?<br />
3. Is this a good price to buy?<br />
4. What is the target price of this stock?<br />
5. Should I exit this stock?</p>
<p>This article will answer all these questions and help you become a self-reliant and confident investor:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5><strong>Consider investing when the price is lower than the intrinsic value</strong></h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The intrinsic value of a company is its actual true value. Its market price can be higher or lower.</p>
<p>Obviously, you should consider investing in a stock only when its actual value is lower than its CMP.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/intrinsic-value-calculator/">Now here&#8217;s a tool that will help you figure out a company&#8217;s intrinsic value</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Here is the explanation of each field:</p>
<p><strong>EPS (Rs)</strong>: The expected Earnings Per Share for the current year</p>
<p><strong>Near Term Growth Rate (%)</strong>: This is based on industry estimates and you can play with different growth scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>For how many years:</strong> This is your estimate. For how long do you expect the company to grow at the rate you specified in the fiels above.</p>
<p><strong>Long Term Growth Levels Off to (%)</strong>: Typically over the long term, growth winds down to lower than the treasury rate. For example, Infosys after growing for more than 21 years saw its growth tapering off to lower than 7% when the treasury rate, which is now at 7.4%. So your estimate of the long term growth rate should be lower than the treasury rate, which is represented by the last field (Discount) below.</p>
<p><strong>Probability (%)</strong>: What are the chances of your assumptions coming true? You can play with different probabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Discount (%)</strong>: This is the safe rate of interest you can expect from a reputed borrower. For example, GOI bonds fetch 7.4%, Vikas Patras fetch 7.5%, Bank FDs fetch 7%, Corporate NCDs fetch 8%. So you have a range to play around with.</p>
<p>As an example, I calculated the Intrinsic value of Gujarat Pipavav, here are my assumptions:</p>
<p>Expected EPS of Rs5 this  year, a 10% growth rate for 6 years, which tapers down to 7% thereafter.The treasury rate assumed is  8% (Corporate Bonds),and the probability of my assumptions coming true at 50%.</p>
<p>This pegs GPPL&#8217;s intrinsic value at 314 and the stock is available at 144.</p>
<p>Typically, one must consider an investment when the stock is about 50%-60% of Intrinsic Value. Though GPPL is available cheaper, it is still not a buy as you will learn in the second half of the article.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GPPL-intrinsic-value.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1720" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GPPL-intrinsic-value.jpg" alt="how to calculate intrinsic value" width="689" height="481" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GPPL-intrinsic-value.jpg 689w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GPPL-intrinsic-value-300x209.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GPPL-intrinsic-value.jpg">2. </a><strong>Learn how To value a loss making company</strong></p>
<p>Many <strong>quality</strong> companies make losses because they keep investing in acquisitions or software development (in the case of IT companies). Such companies&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">EPS is negative and the Intrinsic Value Calculator cannot be used to calculate its true value</span>.</p>
<p>In such cases, you can figure out if the stock is valued right by checking the EV/EBITDA ratio (Enterprise Value (EV) to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation &amp; Amortization (EBITDA)).</p>
<p>The EV a company&#8217;s market capitalization (+) debt  (-) cash.</p>
<h3>A EV/EBITDA ratio of 10 and below is considered good. Beyond 12-15 the stock can be considered overvalued.</h3>
<p>You can figure out any stock&#8217;s EV:EBITDA at the <strong><a href="https://www.stockaxis.com/analyzer/company/Aditya-Birla-Capital-Ltd-242461">Stock Axis&#8217; website</a>.</strong></p>
<p>In this example, I have measured AB Cap&#8217;s EV/EBITDA ratio <span style="text-decoration: underline;">which is below 8</span> and therefore the stock is valued at a decent price.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/EV-EBITDA.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1722 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/EV-EBITDA.jpg" alt="what is EV EBITDA ratio" width="648" height="331" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/EV-EBITDA.jpg 648w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/EV-EBITDA-300x153.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>3. Find your company&#8217;s target price</strong></p>
<p>There are many ways that set up a stock&#8217;s target price.</p>
<p>One method is to estimate current year EPS and multiply it by the industry or peer PE ratio.</p>
<p>Another method is to inflate the industry or peer PE by 130%-150% (depending on market buoyancy) and multiply it by current earnings.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use the calculator on this site &#8211; The <strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/target-price-calculator/">Target Price Calculator</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Here is an example where I have calculated GPPL&#8217;s target price:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/stock-target-price-calculat.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1725" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/stock-target-price-calculat.jpg" alt="how to calculate stock target price" width="689" height="473" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/stock-target-price-calculat.jpg 689w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/stock-target-price-calculat-300x206.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/stock-target-price-calculat-640x440.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px" /></a></p>
<p>Though GPPL&#8217;s intrinsic value is 314, it&#8217;s target price is a mere 120 and it is available at 141. The Target Price Calculator clearly indicates that the stock is overpriced. This will change when it starts reporting better numbers, but for the time being it is an avoid.</p>
<p><strong>4. Other factors</strong></p>
<p>There are other factors that can upset the calculations above &#8211; some examples are insider news, someone taking stake in the company, the company hiving off assets to pay debt, favorable global trends, etc.</p>
<p>These are not accounted in the tools above. To factor these in, you must have your ear to the ground.</p>
<h4>Summing up, these are all the tools you need to figure out if a stock is worth buying, and at what price, and what is its target. It will help you become a self-reliant and confident investor.</h4>

<p>Then there are folks who want to figure out which sectors are on the rise and which stocks can gain in prices and make them a profit either in the short- or the long-term.</p>
<p>Well, instead of asking experts, here is what you got to do:</p>
<h3><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=opulent.stockaxis&amp;hl=en">A. Install the STOCK AXIS app</a></h3>
<p>Here is how the interface looks:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-App-Interface.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1698" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-App-Interface.png" alt="Stock Axis app download" width="720" height="1280" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-App-Interface.png 720w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-App-Interface-169x300.png 169w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-App-Interface-576x1024.png 576w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a></p>
<h3>B. Analyze your Stock</h3>
<p>The Stock Axis  app is a very powerful piece of technology. Backed by a strong algorithm that measures fundamentals, technicals and market activity,  the app allots a number between 1-99, with the 99 score being the strongest.</p>
<p>Read through the ratings information to familiarize yourself:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-App-Rating-1.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1700" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-App-Rating-1-690x1024.png" alt="how stock axis app rates a stock" width="640" height="950" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-App-Rating-1-690x1024.png 690w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-App-Rating-1-202x300.png 202w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-App-Rating-1.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Now, go back to the interface and tap the Analyzer.</p>
<p>Tap the Analyzer and enter your stock name. For example, I entered Aarvee Denims. Here&#8217;s what the app threw up:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-App-Analyzer.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1697" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-App-Analyzer-576x1024.png" alt="how to use the stock axis app" width="576" height="1024" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-App-Analyzer-576x1024.png 576w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-App-Analyzer-169x300.png 169w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-App-Analyzer.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></a></p>
<p>The app rates Aarvee denim at 21/99, which is pretty weak, but suggests that the trend is UP.</p>
<p>The rating and trend are two different things. Stock axis takes into account fundamentals, technicals, volumes, price fluctuations, beta and other factors in their proprietary formula, which no one knows. But it is quite effective.</p>
<p>However, your antenna must go up whenever you see a conflict in the score and the trend suggested by the app. In the case of Aarvee Denims, I would rather track the stock&#8217;s technicals and browse through their news announcements and keep watching price movements before making any decision (because a score of 21/99 is poor).</p>
<p><strong>The Stock Axis app is very powerful</strong>. It also displays quarterly results, annual results, cash flow, key ratios and news. After you are done with checking the trend, you should read the fundamentals, and then head to <strong><a href="http://www.topstockresearch.com/">Top Stock Research</a></strong> to read through the technicals, if you know how to read these.</p>
<h3>C. Figure Out Hot Sectors</h3>
<p>Tap on the Top 10 Industries to figure out trending sectors. You can then tap each sector and check the stocks listed. Tapping on each stock throws up the financial details.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-Sectors.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1696" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-Sectors-576x1024.png" alt="trending sectors NSE" width="576" height="1024" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-Sectors-576x1024.png 576w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-Sectors-169x300.png 169w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-Sectors.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></a></p>
<h3>D. Figure Out Trending Stocks</h3>
<p>Tap on the CHANGE IN TREND to figure out trending sectors. Stock Axis measures stocks every end of day and points out stocks that have reversed their trend.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-Trending-Stock.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1695" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-Trending-Stock-576x1024.png" alt="Trending stocks NSE" width="576" height="1024" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-Trending-Stock-576x1024.png 576w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-Trending-Stock-169x300.png 169w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Stock-Axis-Trending-Stock.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></a></p>
<h3>SUMMING UP</h3>
<p>The Stock Axis app may be a superb piece of technology, but don&#8217;t consider it as the Bible. Use it to figure out your stock&#8217;s trend, learn of buzzing industries and stocks and then head to Top Stock Research (another terrific site) for more incisive technical data.</p>
<p>After performing research, check with your broker before making any decision.</p>
<p>Finally, remember one thing &#8211; that any stock that is losing cash on a operational level for several years in a low does not merit any consideration.</p>
<p>Over to you. Good luck.</p>

<p><strong>AMORPHOUS</strong>: Such plastics soften over a wide range of temperatures, and bond easily well using adhesives. These are easy to thermoform.</p>
<p><strong>SEMI CRYSTALLINE</strong>: Such plastics have better chemical resistance, electrical properties, and work best for bearing, wear and structural applications. But these are difficult to thermoform or bond, and have a sharp melting point.</p>
<p>Now there are four categories of plastics:</p>
<p><strong>Commodity Plastics</strong>: Used in high volume and wide range of applications like packaging, clothing, beverage and trash containers, household products.</p>
<p><strong>Engineering Plastics</strong>: These have better mechanical/thermal properties and are more expensive than commodity plastics. These are used for small objects or low-volume applications (example: mechanical parts).</p>
<p><strong>High Temperature Plastics</strong>: Superior heat-resistant plastics that are suitable in mechanical engineering, workplace technology, textiles. medical, chemical and automobile industry.</p>
<p><strong>Extreme Temperature Plastics</strong>: Melt only in temperatures of 150+° C and are used as reinforcing agents in advanced applications like aerospace, medical, defence.</p>
<p>Now here are the different types of plastics, their uses and the companies that manufacture them. Note that this is a work in progress post and I&#8217;ll keep updating company names as and when I get information:</p>

And if investors fall in love with a bad stock, it can keep sucking on their finances.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sure enough, a quality stock that can cope with disruptions can make you wealth for a few generations if held it for a decade or two, and this post does not cover such stocks. </strong></span></h4>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But others should be treated like grocery items &#8211; use and throw. Here&#8217;s a primer on how to figure out bad stocks:</strong></span></h4>
<h3>A. Corporate Governance Issues</h3>
<p>A few months back, Ricoh India was in the news because of serious corporate governance issues. The auditors had mentioned that the accounts were not true and fair. Plus, the company did not file accounts with BSE on time making the exchange shift its stock to the Z group.</p>
<p>Examples of corporate misgovernance can be a violation of statutory norms (Company Law Board, NCLT, SEBI) or it can be non-disclosure of the true position of finances and assets to a lender, or it can be a fraud perpetuated by the company, or any other violation of ethical norms.</p>
<p>The minute you sense something has happened, it&#8217;s time to dump the stock.</p>
<p>You should watch out for shares transferred to Z group. That will give you a clue.</p>
<h3>B. Disruption</h3>
<p>Business disruption can be a bitch, When computers made their entry, typewriter manufacturers were roasted; when email got popular, many small courier companies went out of business; In 2030 EVs will rule and only the most efficient automobile component makers will survive, and so on and so forth. I&#8217;m sure you get the picture.</p>
<p>To survive, companies must keep up to speed with technological changes. I&#8217;ll give you an example of a stock that I own &#8211; Malu Papers.  The company manufactures newsprint and packaging paper. With ebooks and smartphones dominating the scene, the demand for newsprint has fallen, and so the company is shifting focus to packaging paper, which is witnessing a boom because of increased ecommerce activities.</p>
<p>Likewise, you must keep tabs on the stock you own. If the management is not dynamic, and is not keeping pace with the new normal, it&#8217;s time to dump the stock.</p>
<h3>C. Booking Reasonable Profits</h3>
<p>Many portfolio managers are happy when they can declare a 20%-25% gain on their investments PER YEAR, but individual investors always put up a sulk even after making returns as high as 40%-50% a year.</p>
<p>Unless you plan to make a stock part of your long term portfolio, you should set reasonable targets and sell it when it achieves your goals.Never be greedy, be content  with reasonable returns.</p>
<p>Also, don&#8217;t get too happy when stocks begin to rise rapidly. Just go by your targets and if your target is achieved sooner than expected, you should dump the stock without getting emotional about its future or business model.</p>
<h3>D. Stopping Losses</h3>
<p>I keep saying &#8220;never love a stock&#8221; because like you, I too have loved stocks in the past and have ended up booking losses in many. <a href="https://bullbull.in/blog/the-2-2-2-stock-market-trading-strategy-can-help-you-maximize-gains-and-minimize-losses-influential-brokers-follow-it/"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Here is the trading rule that I follow, and it works beautifully for me &#8211; when it comes to maxing my profits and minimizing losses</strong></span></a>.</p>
<h3>E. Valuation</h3>
<p>An unreasonable (very high) PE or EV:EBITDA ratio is another sign. In 2012, JP Infra was flying high at 52 despite making losses. It was suggested as a value pick by many analysts. Investors who tag themselves as &#8220;value investors&#8221; jumped right in and tanked up on the stock. Then came the bad news and the  stock crashed to 5 (over 2012-2017). It&#8217;s now ruling at 14, with very slim chances of it regaining its old price in the near future.</p>
<p>To figure out your stock&#8217;s intrinsic value and its rating, use the following tools to determine if it&#8217;s holding on to them:</p>

<h3>F. Peer Comparison</h3>
<p>If a stock is pricier than its peers, then there has to be a valid reason &#8211; such as expansion, rights issue, foreign collaboration, new markets, etc. If a stock is pricier than its listed peers without any valid reason, then it may be time to sell, but after thorough research.</p>
<h3>G. Peer Comparison</h3>
<p>If a stock is pricier than its peers, then there has to be a valid reason &#8211; such as expansion, rights issue, foreign collaboration, new markets, merger, demerger, etc. If a stock is pricier than its listed peers without any valid reason, then it may be time to sell, but after thorough research.</p>
<p>Also, if a stock in a sunshine sector is performing badly as compared to its peers, then it may be time to sell.</p>
<h3>H. Better Opportunities</h3>
<p>We are in an age of disruptions. EVs, AI, Blockchain, nano medicine, Robotics, you name it &#8211; the world is changing.</p>
<p>In this age, every investor must latch on to better opportunities that can multiply wealth rapidly.</p>
<p>Take the example of HEG, a carbon and graphite electrode company. It was languishing at 300-400 levels when it was announced that EVs ould be compulsory from 2030 on. BANG, the  stock zoomed non stop to 2000! That&#8217;s the power of disruption.</p>
<p>Therefore if there&#8217;s a better opportunity floating around, you should not hesitate  to jump on to that.</p>
<h3>I. Hype</h3>
<p>Empty vessels make a hell of a lot of noise. These days promoters use their PR firms to exploit business TV  channels to promote their stock. Minute a stock is tracked on TV, it flares up because investors that watch TV jump in.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that stocks recommended on TV are evil. All I&#8217;m saying is that you should not jump in. Rather you should analyze the fundamentals and technicals and then make a decision without succumbing to hype.</p>
<h3>J. Peer Comparison</h3>
<p>If a stock is pricier than its peers, then there has to be a valid reason &#8211; such as expansion, rights issue, foreign collaboration, new markets, etc. If a stock is pricier than its listed peers without any valid reason, then it may be time to sell, but after thorough research.</p>
<h3>K. Low Quality Management</h3>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/blog/how-to-audit-management-quality-of-a-listed-bse-nse-stock/"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Here&#8217;s a guide. Use it to figure out the management quality of the stock you own</strong></span></a>. If the people behind the company don&#8217;t measure up, ditch the stock.</p>
<h3>L. Weakening Fundamentals</h3>
<p>An existing company can have a bad quarter or two depending on economic conditions, and a startup can have a bad year or two because of development issues. That is okay. But you really don&#8217;t expect matters to get any worse from thereon. If they do, and if there&#8217;s no recovery in sight, then it could be time to dump.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://bullbull.in/blog/quickly-efficiently-analyze-annual-report/">Before making a decision to sell, do analyze the Annual Report. Here&#8217;s a guide.</a></span></strong></p>
<h3>To Sum Up</h3>
<p>Finally, if you know the general direction of the market and feel that you can buy the stock back at a cheaper rate, and are almost sure, then you should go ahead and sell it and keep cash in hand and wait for the fall.</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s about it. If you have anything to contribute, please leave a comment and I&#8217;ll reply in time.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, never act emotionally. Be objective and analytical. Good luck.</p>

<p>Therefore, as an investor, you must analyze management quality before making a buy.</p>
<p>Initially I was to write this by taking a company as an example, but my lawyer buddy says that can get me in trouble. So here are some of the ricks I use to figure out management quality.</p>
<p>The only tool you need is the latest Annual Report. This is how you should audit management quality.</p>
<h3>A. Directors&#8217; Quality</h3>
<p>Assume the name of the first director is &#8220;John Doe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perform any or all of the following searches on Google.</p>
<p>&#8220;John Doe&#8221; + scam<br />
&#8220;John Doe&#8221; + politics<br />
&#8220;John Doe&#8221; + court case<br />
&#8220;John Doe&#8221; + cheating</p>
<p>plus, you can search for &#8220;John Doe&#8221; in the &#8220;NEWS&#8221; section on Google.</p>
<p>You can do this with or without the quotation marks. You can use other keywords as well.</p>
<p>You have to perform this search for all the directors. If there&#8217;s any negative news for any person on the board, Google will unearth it for your reading pleasure.</p>
<h3>B. Subsidiaries, Associates and Transactions With Them</h3>
<p>Many companies set up a whole lot of subsidiaries and engage in sell and purchase transactions with them. Genuine companies that mean well do engage in transactions with subsidiaries and associate firms, but these are with good intentions. On the other extreme, shell companies make up most of their sales and purchases from transactions with their subsidiaries. Then there are some companies that lie somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example, Company A sells to its subsidiary, Company B, at the end of a quarter. The subsidiary returns the goods in the next quarter and the sale is reversed. What happens is that the investor and analysts get taken for a ride because of the inflated numbers.</p>
<p>Therefore while analyzing management quality, you must examine the transactions with subsidiaries and associate firms. Look for the following flags.</p>
<p>1. Sales and purchases to/from such companies (are these substantial or even significant when compared to the full year&#8217;s figures?)</p>
<p>2. Rents or consultancy charges paid to promoter. (are these charges being paid despite the company making losses? or how much % of profits are eaten away by such transactions).</p>
<p>If you come across such payments and if these payments are over the normal course of business, then it reflects poorly on the management because it implies diversion of profits from the parent company.</p>
<p>This information can be sourced from the Directors&#8217; Report.</p>
<h3>C. Directors&#8217; Salaries</h3>
<p>If any owner-promoter is drawing a large salary when his company is reporting cash losses, then it is a bad sign. Or, if a promoter-director draws a large salary that seems abnormal when you compare it to the profits, then that too is a sign of low management quality.</p>
<p>There can be a few example, as in the case of pharma or software companies wherein money is pumped into development/discovery of products. In such cases, high salaries are justified.</p>
<p>This information can be sourced from the Directors&#8217; Report.</p>
<h3>D. Qualifications in the Auditor&#8217;s Report</h3>
<p>Though it is boring to read through an audit report, you must go through it to learn if the auditor has a negative view. <strong><a href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/religare-auditors-issue-qualified-opinion-on-dismal-fy17-results-117063000286_1.html">I&#8217;ll give you an example of a publicly reported case &#8211; Religare</a></strong>. Whatever company you invest in, you must read the internal, secretarial and statutory auditors&#8217; reports that are contained in the annual report.</p>
<p>The report will help you understand how the management has sugar coated the accounts by either not providing for expenses or by following fancy accounting policies or by not maintaining statutory books. For example, not providing for interest because the company is in CDR, books destroyed in fire or lost, because of which auditors could not verify the true state of affairs, etc.</p>
<h3>E. Operational Cash Flows</h3>
<p>Any decently managed company generates positive operational cash flows, which it either retains or uses to pay off debt or invest in new businesses. If a running business, unless it is capital-intensive and needs some years to stabilize, cannot generate adequate positive cash flows then there&#8217;s something wrong with the management.</p>
<p>I can also add notes on Corporate Governance, but every management constitutes enough and more committees, at least on paper. that meet the requirements of the Company&#8217;s Act, and therefore I will not go there.</p>
<p>These 5 factors will help you analyze management quality and make an informed decision. Good luck.</p>
