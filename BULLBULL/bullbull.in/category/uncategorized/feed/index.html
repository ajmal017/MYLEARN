<p>Phone companies will sell phones, optic fibre cable companies will lay cables, infra companies will build roads, and software companies will build apps or online utilities.</p>
<p>Of course, to thrive in such an environment you must be neat and clean and have access to all the basics.</p>
<p>Included in the basics is the toilet/bathroom for all (specifically in villages and small towns).</p>
<p>Building toilets are included in the Swacch Bharat Abhiyan and so that angle is covered.</p>
<p>So what is the need for this article? And what is the multibagger sector we&#8217;re talking about?</p>
<p>Well, this article&#8217;s inspired by a chat I had with a couple of my journalist pals.</p>
<p>Running water is essential for all, and specifically for those living in very small towns and villages. Today toilets are being constructed but these are not equipped with running water.</p>
<p>Therefore, subsequent governments will have to spend on laying pipes if they truly want mofussil India to lead a quality life.</p>
<p>Now, we all know water is a scarce resource and that the day is not far when we will establish powerful desalination plants.</p>
<p>But we need water pipes to transport water from the desalination plant to cities and villages.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure the picture has become clear for you folks.</p>
<p>In the long term (say 4-5 years),Â  WATER PIPE companies will be on cloud 9 and if you invest in these today, you&#8217;ll end up very rich.</p>
<p>Now there are two kinds of water pipes &#8211; PVC and iron ductile. PVC pipes can be violated if they stretch for 100s of miles and therefore iron ductile pipes will be used for transporting water over long distances, while PVC pipes will be used for last mile transport.</p>
<p>Here is a list of companies that operate in this space. I have seen that these stocks are being picked up by strong hands. You too can judge by tracking the price and volume data.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remember that you are responsible for all your financial decisions</span></strong>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be happy if you could pitch in with more company names in the comments section. Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>12th July, CNBC Hindi</strong>: Ashish Kukreja, a market expert, recommends Chartered Logistics at 20.80. He delivers a bullish commentary.</p>
<p>Watch his video here.</p>
<p><iframe width="777" height="437" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kVEpx2nbwmg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>13th July</strong>: Chartered Logistics opens strong at 20.85 and jumps to 24 on strong volumes.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-410 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Chartered-Logistics-Chart.jpg" alt="Buy Chartered Logistics " width="667" height="447" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Chartered-Logistics-Chart.jpg 667w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Chartered-Logistics-Chart-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p><strong>13 July, Corporate Announcements</strong>: Chartered Logistics <a href="http://www.bseindia.com/stock-share-price/chartered-logistics-ltd/chlogist/531977/#">discloses to the stock exchange/s that Mr Harsh Gandhi, their Executive Director, would be appearing on CNBC TV 18</a>.</p>
<p><strong>13 July, CNBC TV 18:</strong>Â Nigel D&#8217;souza interviews Mr Harsh Gandhi of Chartered Logistics, who engages in a bullish commentary about the company. Stock spurts from 23.25 to 24, a 3+% jump. It closes at 24.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/disruption-in-market-post-gst-pressurising-logistics-companies-chartered-logistics-2324975.html">Watch that video here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>13 July, Corporate Announcements</strong>: Chartered Logistics <a href="http://www.bseindia.com/stock-share-price/chartered-logistics-ltd/chlogist/531977/#">discloses to the stock exchange/s that ONGC has awarded 24-crore order which is to be executed in 2 years</a>.</p>
<p>Too many coincidences.</p>
<h3>Analysis of this Chartered Logistics Episode</h3>
<ol>
<li>Is it possible that this whole episode was coordinated? That is, recommend on Hindi channel during off market hours on one day and interview the management the next day on the English channel?</li>
<li>If this was unconnected, it implies that the guys at CNBC Hindi and English channels do not coordinate news and interviews.</li>
<li>Is it possible that the recommending analyst, Chartered Logistics, and their PR firm are engaged in an effort to jack up stock prices? Remember that as per my information, PR firms are well connected to TV channels and they arrange interviews for their clients.</li>
<li>If Chartered Logistics management informed the stock exchanges of the CNBC TV18 interview on 13 July, isn&#8217;t it obvious that the interview was fixed a few days earlier?</li>
<li>Does not (4) above imply that the sequence of events tie up and look like a coordinated action?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To Conclude</strong></p>
<p>The good thing about this whole thing is that Chartered Logistics is an okay kind of stock that reported an EPS of 1.4 for the year ended March 2017.</p>
<p>It will surely benefit from GST and its future will depend on how well it is managed.</p>
<p>One thing I&#8217;d advice you folks to do is:</p>
<p>Watch any one CNBC channel (Hindi or English) during market hours and the other during off market hours when stocks are being recommended. If what I have written above turns out to be a pattern, you can help yourself to many winners.</p>

<h3>Before rushing to act on this information, know this:</h3>
<ol>
<li>That this portfolio is as on 31 March 2017.Â Let me give you an example of the importance of time (though you can never time a buy or sell to perfection):Here is the price chart of Geojit, stock that Rakesh has purchased for the quarter ended 31 March 2017.
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-194 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Geojit-Jhunjhunwala.jpg" alt="Rakesh Jhunjhunwala buys Geojit" width="658" height="448" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Geojit-Jhunjhunwala.jpg 658w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Geojit-Jhunjhunwala-300x204.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" /></p>
<p>The first quarter of March 2017 represents the period between 1 January 2017 and 31 March 2017.</p>
<p>At that time, Geojit was hovering around 50 bucks, which is the price at which Rakesh would have entered. At the time of writing this article, its price is 83.</p>
<p>Now it is possible that even though Rakesh is a long term investor, he may unload Geojit if he senses senseless euphoria or a market crash. He would have made his money and if you have purchased at these levels, you&#8217;d be left holding the baby.</p>
<p>So, be cautious, it&#8217;s your money.</li>
<li>Do not act on this blog post. It is mere information. Talk to your financial advisor/broker and use your judgment.</li>
<li>All the information published here is in public domain, all you have to do is search for it.</li>

<p>I am his fan as well and cling on to every word he says and try toÂ read between the lines, as far as I can.</p>
<p>His tweets and comments on TV send investors into a stock-buying frenzy with recent examples of binge-buying being <a href="http://www.bseindia.com/stock-share-price/shalimar-paints-ltd/shalpaints/509874/">Shalimar Paints</a>, <a href="http://www.bseindia.com/stock-share-price/orient-bell-limited/orientbell/530365/">Orient Bell</a>Â and <a href="http://www.bseindia.com/stock-share-price/mirza-international-ltd/mirzaint/526642/">Mirza International</a>.<img /></p>
<blockquote><p>This is my first blog post and you can say that it is like a tribute to Porinju&#8217;s stock picking genius.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Without much ado, here is a screenshot of Prinju&#8217;s personal portfolio as on 31 March 2017.</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-109 size-full" src="http://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Porinju-Veliyath-Portfolio.jpg" alt="Porinju veliyath stock picks" width="600" height="659" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Porinju-Veliyath-Portfolio.jpg 600w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Porinju-Veliyath-Portfolio-273x300.jpg 273w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see, Porinju has:</p>
<p>EXITED</p>
<p>1. BDH Industries<br />
2. Emkay Global</p>
<p>REDUCED</p>
<ol>
<li>Izmo</li>
<li>Balkrishna Paper Mills (over Sep 2016)</li>
</ol>
<p>INCREASED</p>
<ol>
<li>Sarda Plywood</li>
</ol>
<h3>Before analysing Porinju&#8217;s portfolio,Â know this:</h3>
<ol>
<li>That this portfolio is as on 31 March, and that one day, one single moment in the stock marketÂ moves at the speed of sound. So it is possible that Porinju has shuffled his portfolio dramatically since then.</li>
<li>I agree with his decision to reduce Izmo because after going through the company&#8217;s website it does seem that their business modelÂ has not kept pace with the changes on the ground.</li>
<li>Do not act on this blog post. It is mere information. I suggest you contact Porinju on his Twitter handle and chat with him before making any decision. In any case, he, or any analyst for that matter, will not give you tips, so it&#8217;s up to you.</li>
<li>All the information published here is in public domain, all you have to do is search for it.</li>
