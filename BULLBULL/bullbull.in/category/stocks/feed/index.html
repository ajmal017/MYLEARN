<p>Before you go any further, know this:</p>
<ol>
<li>I own some stock (disclosure).</li>
<li>Markets are copy and therefore the information in this post should be absorbed and the stock should be tracked.</li>
<li>In my opinion, the stock becomes attractive when it drops to 10-12 levels.</li>
<li>All the information in this post is based on a phone call to the Gujarat Poly Electronics office.</li>
</ol>
<p>REASONS WHY IT MAKES SENSE TO CONSIDER/ADD GUJARAT POLY ELECTRONICS TO YOUR PORTFOLIO</p>
<ol>
<li>The company belongs to the reputed Polychem group of companies. The promoter pedigree is good.</li>
<li>It was formed as a JV between AVX Electronics, USA &#8211; Polychem and Gujarat Industrial Investment Corporation Limited (GIIC) ro manufacture single layer and multi layer capacitors.</li>
<li>Over time, the company was hit by competition by China and suffered losses.</li>
<li>The business was restructured and AVX Electronics exited the business in 2016-17. Their share was bought by Polychem.</li>
<li>In 2016-17, the company changed its strategy. It moved away from making the ordinary capacitors to value added capacitors (Radial Multi Layer Ceramic Capacitors) which are used in advanced applications like aerospace, telecommunications, defence, etc.</li>
<li>One of the key ingredient of the new strategy was that the company would not produce capacitor parts. INSTEAD, it would import parts from China and assemble these to create Radial MLCCs.</li>
<li>The company has since turned around and has started making modest profits. Turnover has increased in 2017-18 and the company should clock an EPS of about 75 paise for the year.</li>
<li>The installed capacity for manufacturing MLCCs is 20 crore MLCCs per annum. However, there is no limit to MLCCs that are assembled.</li>
<li>Radial MLCCs are priced between 35 paise and Rs 5 per piece, depending n their capacity. For the sake of approximation, let&#8217;s peg the average rate realized by Gujarat Poly Electronics at Rs 2.50 per MLCC.</li>
<li>Let us assume that 2 years down the line, the company assembles and sells 14 crore MLCCs (70% of capacity). Its turnover will shoot to 40 crores. 2017-18 turnover will close at about 15 crores.</li>
<li>The story does not stop here. The company has tied up with a MNC (Diotec Semicondustors, Germany) to distribute their products in India. The demand for semiconductors is rising phenomenally. The business potential of this new venture is not factored into the price.</li>
</ol>
<p>These inputs are based on my conversation with Mr Punyani who is based at the company&#8217;s HO in Ahmedabad. I picked up the stock after this conversation and tweeted about it. This blog post is FYI.</p>

<ol>
<li>The company was formed in 1992 and listed in 2000 and at that time it manufactured hardware. It immediately ran into a wall of competition from the unorganized sector and this made it run into losses.</li>
<li>Its financial situation was grim (BIFR)  but because the company&#8217;s management was clean, it survived and hung on.</li>
<li>The turnaround started from 2011-12 after it forayed into e-waste management. This is going to be the mainstay of the company going forward along with its AMC (Annual Maintenance Contracts) and EMS (Electronic Manufacturing Services) which makes motherboards, memory modules, graphic cards and networking products, Repairs and Refurbishment market and High Capacity Hardware manufacture.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.cerebra-me.com/">The company has set up offices in the Middle East</a> (</strong>UAE, Saudi, Qatar) where it distributes Canon&#8217;s products, along with its hardware business. It has more than 170 resellers in that region.</li>
<li>In 2013, it acquired Cimelia Resource Recovery Pte. Ltd., an ewaste processor based in Singapore.</li>
<li>In 2015, Cerebra entered into a JV with <strong><a href="http://www.echostreams.com/">Echostream</a></strong> to make storage servers. Given the boom in cloud computing, storage servers are hugely in demand.</li>
<li>The company also has built an Automated Driving Test System (ADTS) for which it has bagged a large order from Transport Department, Government of Karnataka for testing and issuing driving licenses. The company owns a surveillance software which it uses across different applications, driving tests being one such.</li>
<li>The company also have dived deep in the refurbishment market. This business is in a nascent stage in India and has fantastic potential. In developed countries, refurbishers do phenomenally well.</li>
<li>It owns a subsidiary, <a href="http://www.cerebracomputers.com/cerebralpo.com/aboutus.html">Cerebra LPO</a>, which offers onsite and offsite legal help to law firms in the USA and UK. <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>UPDATE: The company has cut down the Cerebra LPO operations, which now functions as a BPO out of Bangalore.</strong></span></li>
<li>The company also owns a medical transcription facility.</li>
<li>It also sets up and maintains hardware in eGovernance centers in Bangalore.</li>
<li>Having said all this, the company&#8217;s main business going forward will be eWaste recycling and refurbishing, plus all of the above, which will now become secondary.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore,</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>you should understand the eWaste business model</strong></span>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The eWaste Business Model</h3>
<p>Precious metals such as gold, palladium, rhodium and silver are used in the manufacture of electronics.</p>
<p>With technological obsolescence fast catching up, and with rising incomes and the desire to own new stuff, old devices are often replaced, and such old devices are sent to ewaste recycling centers.</p>
<p>The recycler then processes the electronic waste and extracts the precious metals, which it sells.</p>
<p>As of date, 100s of Indian entrepreneurs are minting money by setting up recycling facilities.</p>
<h3>Cerebra&#8217;s and India&#8217;s eWaste Business Potential</h3>
<ol>
<li><b><b><a href="http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/India-fifth-largest-producer-of-e-waste-study/article14340415.ece">As per reports, India generates 18.5 lakh metric tonnes of eWaste every year</a>. <a href="http://www.assocham.org/newsdetail.php?id=5725">Not just that, the waste keeps growing at a compounded rate of 30% every year.</a></b></b>Companies that generate and keep collecting eWaste without getting rid of it effectively will have to pay a stiff penalty as you can read in the article linked first.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.indigoedge.com/IE%20Insight%20-%20India%20eWaste%20Processing.pdf">In 2013, given the commodity prices at that time, it was estimated that processing 1 tonne of eWaste would yield Rs 58,535 worth of revenue of minerals</a></strong>. It will be safe to assume &#8211; given the inflation in commodity prices &#8211; that the current figure would be in the region of Rs 70,000-75,000 per tonne. Let us assume Rs 70,000/tonne.<br />
The cost per tonne is about Rs Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 and many companies who do not wish to pay a penalty often give away their eScrap for free.</li>
<li>Cerebra&#8217;s ewaste processing capacity is 36,000 tonnes per annum, with potential for increase to 96,000 tonnes.</li>
<li>So, as on today if we take Cerebra&#8217;s total capacity of 36,000 tonnes per annum and multiply it by Rs 70,000 per tonne (see 2 above), we get 252 crores. The EBITDA can be assumed at 60% given the fact that raw material is either free or too damn cheap. <b>The current sales of the company are 145 crores on a standalone basis and should witness a substantial jump in the current year 2017-18</b>. <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>UPDATE: The company&#8217;s ewaste plant is currently working at 30% capacity (2 days in a  week). This is because the company has to add some machinery. The recent preferential issue to Kuber Fund and the promoters should trigger the process.</strong></span></li>
<li>The company&#8217;s capital is 110 crores and if the net profit of the ewaste facility works out to 20%, we are looking at an additional EPS of Rs 5 per annum.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>UPDATE: The eWaste plant is currently operating at 30% of its capacity and is expected to operate at 100% of its capacity in FY 2018-19. Thereafter, the company will increase capacity in FY 19-20.</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The Negatives</strong></span></h3>
<ol>
<li>The book value is a measly 15.60.</li>
<li>The 2018 EPS may not exceed 2 bucks.</li>
<li>The company has issued FCCBs which will get converted into equity shares at Rs 10.50 before December 2019. This will swell the capital and reduce the earnings.</li>
<li>The trade receivables and trade payables are humongous. Standalone Sales are 145 crores and debtors are 173 crores (last year 30 crores, so 143 crores were added this year). Consolidated sales are 250 crores and debtors are 216 crores (last year 60 crores, so 156 crores were added this year). It looks dicey and has to be clarified by the management. The trade payables also have jumped from 2 crores in 2016 to 137 crores in 2017 (standalone), and though it is not clarified in the AR, there seems to be some correlation in the near-identical rise of both receivables and payables. <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Update: The increase in debtors and creditor were because of government contracts. This is what the company guys told me.</strong></span></li>
<li>The auditors have stated that capital advances amounting to Rs. 37 crores and trade receivables amounting to Rs. 19.5 crores are outstanding for more than 3 years and may not be recoverable. But the management is confident of recovering these.  This raises another question.</li>
<li>These questions need to be clarified by the company and will be followed up by me shortly.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Unless the company clarifies on the negatives, it does not become a buy. <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Update: The company has clarified, as marked above.</strong></span></p>
<p>If the ewaste business takes off and when the plant runs to full capacity (96000 tonnes), we are looking at an EPS of at least 17, plus its earnings from the other subsidiaries and Indian businesses. <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Update: IMO, this is a long termer and can work out well if you hold it for at least 2-3 years.</strong></span></p>
<p>I also have heard from sources that the company is going out all guns blazing on its ewaste and refurbishment business. The refurbishment business also holds phenomenal potential. <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Update: This is true. the refurbishment business is part of the ewaste division.</strong></span></p>
<p>Kuber Fund has bought 1.19 crore shares and the promoters have bought 53 lakh shares at 40. The downside is capped and the potential is huge, but it must first satisfy investors about the negatives pointed out upstairs. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Till then it is not a buy. <span style="color: #008000;">Update: It is only a buy if you are prepared to hold it for the long term.</span></strong></span></p>

<p>At the time of writing this post, the government is in the mood to privatize PSUs and IFCI is no exception.</p>
<p>IFCI is a troubled stock with over 7500 crore NPAs and is losing cash.</p>
<p>BUT, there&#8217;s a gold lining:</p>
<ol>
<li>The government is beating lax and irresponsible babus with a stick and IFCI management is busy  optimizing operations. Last year they closed 7 poorly performing branches.</li>
<li>It is very likely that the government will part-privatize IFCI to make the company efficient. It has made a start with SAIL.</li>
</ol>
<h3>IFCI owns very valuable subsidiaries and rich assets. Let&#8217;s discuss these:</h3>
<p>IFCI&#8217;S SUBSIDIARIES</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stock Holding Corporation of India</strong> (SHCIL): Needs no introduction to investors. In turn SHCIL owns 2 subsidiaries &#8211;  (i) SHCIL Services (stock broking) Ltd and (ii) Stock Holding Document Management Services Limited. IFCI holds 53%.</li>
<li><strong>IFCI Infrastructure Development Ltd</strong> (IIDL) &#8211; a real estate development company. It also owns a hotel in Delhi (Fraser Suites), commercial and residential properties, and factory lands. IFCI holds 100%.</li>
<li><strong>IFCI Venture Capital Funds Ltd</strong> &#8211; fund for startups with focus on rural areas. IFCI holds 99%.</li>
<li><strong>IFCI Financial Services Ltd</strong> (Stock, commodity and currency trading). IFCI holds 95%.</li>
<li><strong>IFCI Factors</strong> (Financing on the basis of accounts receivables). IFCI holds 99%.</li>
<li><strong>MPCON</strong> &#8211; Technical and project consultancy. IFCI holds 80%.</li>
</ol>
<h3>IFCI&#8217;S ASSOCIATES</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tourism Finance Corpn of India</strong> (IFCI holds 26% stake) &#8211; Promotes tourism</li>
<li><strong>KITCO Ltd</strong> &#8211; Builds airport infra. IFCI holds 20%.</li>
<li><strong>INSTITUTE OF LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT</strong> and <strong>MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE</strong>&#8211; management institutes</li>
</ol>
<h3>IFCI&#8217;S INVESTMENTS</h3>
<ol>
<li>Quoted securities worth 497.23 crores. It owns some cats and dogs and a whole lot of blue chips valued at acquisition cost.</li>
<li>IFCI owns a lot of unquoted shares that can potentially wipe out a good part of its NPAs, perhaps all of the NPAs. For example, it owns 20,00,000 Clearing Corporation of India Ltd shares at Rs 10 each. Though the valuation of CCIL is not disclosed, its EPS is about  Rs 75 and therefore on a conservative basis that each share can be valued at about Rs 1,000.It also owns 1.20 crore shares of NSE at 116. Considering BSE is quoting around 850, NSE should quote much higher.Likewise, IFCI owns crores of shares in unlisted companies &#8211; all of which have solid potential. Another example is that of Meta Alloys of which IFCI owns 2.8 crore shares at 19 bucks. <a href="http://www.engineering.com/Products.aspx?page=comp/MET041">Meta Alloys is a significant manufacturer of copper and copper alloys and it is based in Goa</a>. Any one dark horse share when listed can wipe out IFCI&#8217;s NPAs.
<p>Total value (at cost) of all of IFCI&#8217;s investments is 5,557.40 crores. Applying a very low and rough market value of Rs Rs 100 per instrument gets us 55,574 crores &#8211; about 7+ times IFCI&#8217;s NPAs.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Rounding up, it makes immense sense to consider making an investment in IFCI because:</strong></p>
<p>1. Government is proactive in controlling its lax management<br />
2. Privatization may be around the corner<br />
3. IFCI owns fantastic assets<br />
4. IFCI can demerge subsidiaries and create massive value for its investors<br />
5. The government&#8217;s focus on infrastructure makes it a compelling play in the sector.</p>

<p>In developed countries, helping businesses comply with laws is very big business. I know because I have published compliance journals in the areas of construction claims and affordable housing (among others) for the American audience.</p>
<p>Out here, the compliance business is scattered. CAs, E-Gov Suvidha centers, and lawyers help companies stay on the right side of the law. But as such, this support is not organized.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://www.irisbusiness.com/"><strong>IRIS Business Services</strong></a>, wa MSME company listed on BSE, which is seeking to exploit this niche.</p>
<p>Now before you read any further, know that:</p>
<p>(i) I have no holding in the stock</p>
<p>(ii) I do not know the management or promoters. This is the first time I am interacting with them.</p>
<p>(iii) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The gist of the interview in one sentence is that you should track the stock and follow its half yearly results, and reconcile what is said in this interview with the actual</span>.</p>
<p>Here we go:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Your business model please, considering that business markup XBRL providers are aplenty.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p>We have 3 businesses.</p>
<p><strong>COLLECT</strong>: Solutions for regulators, <strong><u>most of our money comes from here</u></strong>. Our technology powers the compliance platform for regulators like RBI in India, ACRA in Singapore and so on. 22 regulators in 16 countries are our clients already. That is the count at this stage. This is Enterprise software. Income is one time sale plus AMC. We’re moving it to a SAAS model, 1st such deployment has been successfully carried out in Mauritius</p>
<p><strong>CREATE</strong>: Solutions for filers to create submissions that are ready to file. We have 4 products: IRIS GST for GST filings and IRIS CARBON for filings by enterprises are SAAS offerings. iDeal (for banks and financial institutions) and iReport are desk top softwares.</p>
<p><strong>CONSUME</strong>: There are two kinds of offerings: Software that we sell to regulators and data that we sell to end users. This business will find its feet in about 12 months.</p>
<p>Jason Voss, Content Director of the CFA Institute said this of us a few years ago: &#8220;Separately, the IRIS platform I referred to is a piece of software of which I received a sneak preview. It will do exactly what you are asking about and way, way, way more. It is the most powerful piece of software I have ever seen for financial professionals.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/05/12/the-top-five-accounting-mistakes-analysts-make/">You also can check out Jason’s comment on this CFA blog</a>.</p>
<p>Two things that came out of this are:</p>
<p>Our platform helped us:</p>
<ol>
<li>Publish our <a href="http://irisbusiness.com/investors/financials">half yearly results</a> in not just English but also Hindi, Gujarati and Telugu. Next time it will be in all 22 languages, our contribution to financial inclusion. It is also a software that we can sell to all listed Indian companies who are interested.</li>
<li>Our software can help companies allow users to download financials into an Excel sheet automatically from filings. It can be set up such that the data downloads into your financial model automatically for every company you are interested in. It is a one-time set up that creates an annuity stream.</li>
</ol>
<p>4 years ago, we made most of our money from &#8220;Create&#8221; which was then a KPO offering.</p>
<p>Today, we make most of our money from &#8220;Collect&#8221; this is a nice cash flow business which can cover our non discretionary costs and also gets us into bed with the regulator.</p>
<p>Going forward, the big jump will come from &#8220;Create&#8221; and &#8220;Consume&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, yesterday, we <a href="http://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/db80cc85-c559-4de9-8ab7-2019557ffca8.pdf">announced </a>the launch of our product IRIS Carbon for South Africa, our local partner is <a href="http://www.eoh.co.za/">EOH</a>, the biggest IT firm in that country. This is an offering from the &#8220;Create&#8221; stable. Market size: 100000 companies. Price range: B/w US $ 500 &#8211; 5000 annually depending on company size. Competition: 11 other providers.</p>
<p>Our competitive edge in South Africa:</p>
<ol>
<li>The regulator has contracted with us for the tech platform to receive the filings.</li>
<li>Our partner EOH has a presence in 130 locations across South Africa</li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Question:<br />
</strong><br />
What is the monthly or yearly recurring expense you have to pay for data access in different countries?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>In our data business, we don&#8217;t buy any data from any data provider at this time but this will change next year when we start investing more in that business.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Why did your sales fall in 2016-17? Did you lose any clients? If yes, why.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p>Until 4 years ago, we were primarily a KPO. A US client (Merrill Corp) would ship files of their clients to us, we would convert them into XBRL using our own tools and send them back for filing to the US SEC.</p>
<p><strong>With automation, we knew that this business would soon fold up, so we exited the business totally, causing revenues to fall steeply from a high of close to Rs 70 cr. That&#8217;s when we switched to products and rejigged the business totally. So sales did not fall just last year, it has been falling over the last 4 years.</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Now we are turning around as the order book will show. </u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Some of the risks that you mentioned are associated with the business were capital sourcing and cost competitiveness. How have you addressed these since 31 March 2017?<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>What is happening is that as we seem to have more wins than our global peers, they have started competing with us on price and price alone. Secondly they are also much better funded than us.</p>
<p>By leveraging Indian cost structures to develop products, we hope to stay ahead of the competition. What we need to do is to build a war chest to take on global competition. <strong><u>For that our financials have to first improve, I suppose</u></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Your debt as on 31-3-17 was 12 crores, and per your presentation you have repaid 3 crores from the IPO proceeds.</p>
<p>You are now left with 9 crore debt. At 11.5% interest, your interest outgo is 1 crore per annum. Now, assuming you have arrested the fall in sales and have steadied ship, it still leaves you with a loss for 2017-18. Am I correct?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Our order book is getting healthier, so we have arrested the fall in sales, yes. Over the last 4 years, falling sales in the wake of change in the business model took its toll on the company.</p>
<p>The good thing about where we have now reached is that it should not be too difficult to cover our non discretionary expense which is basically costs on account of staffing, finance, utilities and other overheads.</p>
<p><u>I must hasten to add however that the nature of the products business is such that projecting revenues is slightly hazardous as I am sure you can appreciate. Our focus is to increase the share of recurring revenues so that investors get comfort.</u></p>
<p>On the debt side, there is a bank loan and there was the short term borrowing of Rs 3 crore which we have cleared.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Have you got your SaaS software valued by an independent and accredited firm?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>No we have not. Perhaps you could tell me how you think the company may benefit from such an exercise.</p>
<p>(<em><u>Interviewer’s note: perhaps a software evaluation will lend comfort to investors until financials improve</u></em>).</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Your sales are 27 crores and your debtors stand at 7.7 crores. That&#8217;s an unusually long debtor credit cycle. Can you explain why?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>It is typically 3 months, but truth be told, exceptions are those who pay on time.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Your building is on lease. What are the terms?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The office is located at Vashi station in Navi Mumbai, we bought it from the previous occupant who had bought it from CIDCO whose typical contracting terms is a long lease instead of an outright sale</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>When do you see your subsidiaries turning around?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Our subs are basically because we are often required to have a local entity for contracting purposes. Singapore is the only place where we have staff for sales and delivery. More recently, we have staffed up the US office as well with a sales person.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Though Iris Business Services has a very exciting business model (RegTech) and it partners global financial firms such as Deloitte Haskins, KPMG, etc. to serve their clients, it makes sense for investors to track its order book, half -yearly results (MSMEs are allowed to file half yearly results) and news announcements.</p>
<p>Any sign of a turnaround should be taken as a clue to invest, especially given the management’s comments that the order book is healthy and growing. Till the company starts delivering profits, track the company because of its unique and interesting business model.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>It&#8217;s becoming increasingly difficult to spot multibaggers in an overheated market. As investment advisor, Kenneth Andrade says, it is best to buy companies now that are making good money in depressed market conditions.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h4>IVP Ltd, which belongs to the Dubai-based Allana group, is one such company, and here is why I consider it a potential multibagger:</h4>
<p><strong>1. PROMOTER-MANAGEMENT PEDIGREE</strong></p>
<p>The Allana group, founded since 1865, is a US $5 billion dollar group based out of Dubai. IVP Ltd India is professionally managed with experienced and competent people holding the reins (Vishal Pandit and Mandar Joshi).</p>
<p>Now,, being a $5 billion group can can also be a negative because when you have so much money, you really may not want more. However, the businesses of IVP are such that the company&#8217;s growth looks like it is set on auto pilot.</p>
<p>To know why, we need to understand their product profile.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>2. PRODUCTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Polyurethane systems</strong> (used in footwear)</p>
<p><strong>Foundry materials</strong> (used in iron, steel alloys making, cores &amp; moulds, ferrous and non ferrous castings, automotive castings, graphite coatings, magnesite and other foundry coatings)</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1219 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IVP3.jpg" alt="IVP India makes composite resins" width="1174" height="502" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IVP3.jpg 1174w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IVP3-300x128.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IVP3-768x328.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IVP3-1024x438.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1174px) 100vw, 1174px" /></p>
<p><strong>Composite Resins</strong> &#8212; THIS IS THE FUTURE! &#8212; <a href="http://www.machinedesign.com/materials/replacing-metal-plastic">Performance plastics are set to replace conventional metals in aerospace, defence and automobile applications</a>. You can either google this or click the link to know how performance plastics will dominate the future.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1220 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IVP.jpg" alt="IVP India graphite and composite materials" width="1210" height="636" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IVP.jpg 1210w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IVP-300x158.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IVP-768x404.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IVP-1024x538.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1210px) 100vw, 1210px" /></p>
<p><strong>Insulation Resins</strong> &#8211; A global major that also makes insulation resins is ELANTAS. It is listed in India as Elantas Beck &#8211; go check its price.</p>
<p><strong>Refractory Resins</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an extract from the IVP AR&#8217;s management discussion, enough to make one bullish:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1223 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IVP4.jpg" alt="IVP materials of the future" width="830" height="561" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IVP4.jpg 830w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IVP4-300x203.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IVP4-768x519.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 830px) 100vw, 830px" /></p>
<p>Okay, now we have great parentage, products with potential, and so it&#8217;s time to move on to finances.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>3. IVP FUNDAMENTALS</strong></p>
<p>The company has already booked expenditure for modernising its factories in Bangalore and Tarapur, and that hit been accounted for.</p>
<p><strong>Equity</strong> &#8211; 10.32 crores of which 70% is held by the management<br />
<strong>Reserves</strong> &#8211; 62.45 crores<br />
<b>Debt</b>&#8211; 13.95 crores<br />
<strong>BV</strong> &#8211; 70 PER SHARE!<br />
<strong>EPS</strong>  10.84 in a year where its plants were being modernized.</p>
<p>The net fixed assets of the company have jumped from 19 crores in 2015-16 to 35.30 crores in 2016-17 &#8211; a clear indication of good times coming for customers and shareholders, and a bad time for the competitors. All investments were made from the accumulated cash reserves.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><strong>negative</strong></span> &#8212; the sales are 181 crores and the debtors stand at 61 crores, indicating a lengthy debtor cycle.  But that is more or less balanced out by a 2.5-month creditor cycle.</p>
<p>Net cash generated from operations is about 4.93 crores in 2016-17.</p>
<p>The company has provided for bad debts of 2.75 crores in full, so there&#8217;s no future hit expected on their accounts.</p>
<p>The company also pays out dividend regularly (20% in 2016-17) and it is a matter of time before it is picked up by an aggressive mutual fund.</p>
<h4>The most exciting thing about IVP Ltd is the disruptions that are about to hit the industry. The company seems primed for the future which is not what you can say about some of its competitors.</h4>
<p>It looks like a fabulous  medium-long term buy and as this article has been published on a Sunday, you have enough time to research and form an opinion.</p>

Two famous turnaround companies are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Symphony and Vipul</span>, both of which were penny stocks, and in losses, once upon a time.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h2>Here is why I consider Malu Papers to be a solid turnaround waste-to-wealth company for the long term:</h2>
<p>Another thing &#8212; before acting on the information, know that the company&#8217;s promoters are picking up shares from the market. This implies that there may be operators at play and that the price may drop a bit before action begins.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Let&#8217;s start with a negative that can actually be a positive</strong> &#8212; most of the promoters&#8217; shareholding is pledged with banks. Given that the company has successfully completed its CDR program, it is unlikely that banks will sell shares in case of default (which will not happen because of the <strong>huge positive cash flows</strong>). In the worst case scenario, the banks will sell the pledged shares to a suitable bidder, which can be good news in the long run, if at all it comes to that.<br />
&#8212;-</li>
<li>The company owns 3 manufacturing units, in Nagpur, having a capacity of <strong>13500 TPA</strong> of Kraft Paper , <strong>19800 TPA</strong> of Newsprint and <strong>49500 MT</strong> of Quality Newsprint and Writing Printing Paper. The infrastructure facilities are best in class.<br />
&#8212;-</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Malu Paper is a waste-to-wealth company</strong></span>. It helps conserve the environment by recycling old corrugated cartons into Machine Glazed (MG) Kraft Paper, and waste paper into newsprint. Waste to wealth companies will end up making big money going forward as our population keeps increasing and waste goes on multiplying.<br />
&#8212;-</li>
<li>Though growing digitization is reducing the consumption of paper in urban areas, the growing rural literacy will more than offset the demand shortfall &#8212; at least in India. That way, Malu Papers is covered from a potential fall in paper demand. <strong>Moreover, the company makes packaging paper which is hugely in demand because of the ecommerce boom</strong>. Most importantly, the management is shifting focus to packaging paper than newsprint, <strong>which is fantastic news</strong>. The company also has optimised its production processes and will surely witness better realisations in the future.<br />
&#8212;-</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GST will help by closing down unorganized players and enabling existing players increase demand and capacities</span> going forward. The first quarter of 2017 has not seen encouraging results mainly because the introduction of GST may have hit demand in the short run. The picture is now clearing up and Malu Paper, being an organized player, will benefit going forward.<br />
&#8212;-</li>
<li>The company supplies newsprint to many prominent <strong>Hindi and Marathi</strong> news papers along with <strong>Hindustan Times and The Indian Express</strong>. Kraft paper is supplied to top clients such as <strong>Haldirams, Indo Rama, Hindustan Lever, Marico</strong>, etc.<br />
&#8212;-</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Promoters hold about 68.48% of the equity (17 crores) and one promoter has been picking up small quantities lately</em></span>.<br />
&#8212;-</li>
<li>For the year ended 31-3-17, the company has repaid about 8 crores of its total debt, which now stands at 92 crores (56 cr secured and 36 cr unsecured). Unsecured loans have been obtained from associate companies.<br />
&#8212;-</li>
<li>The company&#8217;s sales for 31-3-17 were 253 crores and sundry debtors were only 23 crores, implying a 1-month credit cycle, which is a very healthy sign.<br />
&#8212;-</li>
<li>The company generated 21.70 crores cash from its operations and used 8 cores to repay loans and 13 crores towards interest. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Actually, interest is the only thorn in the flesh for this company</strong></span>.<br />
&#8212;-</li>
<li>The company&#8217;s reserves turned black from red during 2016-17. For the year, 2016-17, the company has 6. crore reserves against a negative 2.2 crore reserves for 2015-16.<br />
&#8212;-</li>
<li>Now, here&#8217;s one of the things that makes me feel very bullish about Malu Papers &#8212; The company pays about 16% interest to banks. Given the declining rates of interest, it will not be tough for the company to get banks to substantially reduce the applicable rates. Of course, this is my opinion and the logic is that the prime lending rates of banks are now hovering below 10%. I also get this feeling that the company may have renegotiated the interest rates, which could be one of the reasons why the promoter is buying shares.<br />
<img class="alignnone wp-image-1115 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Malu-papers-interest.jpg" alt="interest burden on malu papers" width="646" height="263" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Malu-papers-interest.jpg 646w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Malu-papers-interest-300x122.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px" /><br />
&#8212;-</li>
<li>The debt levels of the company will keep reducing as per the terms of the CDR scheme and the company will become debt free in 5-6 years.<br />
&#8212;-<strong>Well, that&#8217;s about it. Malu Papers is a perfect example of a turnaround company that is about to do very well in the future (which is why it is available at 33 bucks, FV 10). It owns solid infrastructure, great clients, bulky cash flow and a management that is continuously optimizing product mix to ensure higher realizations and shareholder return. Lowering of the interest rate, and an ecommerce/FMCG/Pharma boom will add substantially to the profits.</strong></p>
<h2>Apart from the above, the biggest story is waste-to-wealth. Such companies may even be rewarded by the government (in the form of tax incentives) going forward.</h2>
<p><span style="color: #003300;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Investors with a long term horizon of 2 years can research some more and consider investing in this hidden gem.</strong></span></em></span></li>

<h3>That is taking a limited view because what ultimately prevails over all indicators is the business model.</h3>
<p>A company can be in a loss and it&#8217;s technical and fundamental data can be poor, but if it is in a disruptive or a futuristic business, savvy investors will spot it and place their bets on it as the hoi polloi go on selling.</p>
<p>You have Rain Commodities, HEG, Amazon, and many other stocks as prime examples of stocks with solid business models which languished because the typical investor did not see any value in them.</p>
<h3>One stock with an absolutely fantastic business model and average earnings is DeNora India.</h3>
<p>DeNora is an Italian MNC and the best thing about DeNora India is now in full control of its MNC parent. The second best thing is that the Indian arm can now fully tap into all the businesses of its Italian parent.</p>
<p>Now here is what DeNora is presently doing:</p>
<h3>DeNora Products in India</h3>
<p>The company makes the following products for the electrochemical industry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cathode &amp; Anode for Chlor-Alkali Industry</li>
<li>Electrochlorinators</li>
<li>Cathodic Protection Systems</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Two prime applications are water purification (for various industries) and desalination</strong>.</p>
<p>Water is the new gold. Population is increasing, water table is shrinking and water bodies are going dry, which is why we are seeing such a hue and cry about saving water. Even PM Modi went shopping for desalination technologies when on his trip to Israel.</p>
<p>Guess what, DeNora&#8217;s parent is also in desalination plants and the Indian arm already has started working in that direction.</p>
<p>Moreover the company also has launched a solar-based water purification system for far flung rural communities a move that goes well with the government&#8217;s initiative.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1076 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Denora2.jpg" alt="denora India desalination" width="792" height="442" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Denora2.jpg 792w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Denora2-300x167.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Denora2-768x429.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px" /></p>
<h3>DeNora Services in India</h3>
<p>55% of DeNora India&#8217;s turnover comes from services, and these high tech consultancy services in the fields of Titanium metal anodes/cathodes and electrochlorinators.</p>
<h3>Immediate Prospects</h3>
<p>As I said before, the best thing about DeNora India is that now it is directly controlled by its parent, and because of that it can set up the following businesses, all of which are emerging businesses:</p>
<ol>
<li>The company owns technologies that <strong>improve fruit and vegetable cultivations and animal breeding</strong>. The company also provides technologies and products that help <strong>increase the shelf life of foods and ensure that food processing is done hygienically</strong>. Think about the food processing summit going on presently and about the business it can bring to India. On animal breeding technologies, think Godrej Agrovet.</li>
<li><strong>Corrosion protection and pipeline reinforcement</strong> technologies and brands. This is again huge given the vast scope of gas and water pipelines that are yet to be laid in India.</li>
<li><strong>Water and wastewater treatment services to the oil and gas</strong> sector. The gas sector, given the thrust on clean fuels, is about to see a mega bullish phase with foreign companies competing with Indian giants. DeNora stands to benefit. Secondly, the company can extend its wastewater treatment technologies into other industries, in fact, this company is a competitor <strong>to Ion Exchange</strong>.</li>
<li>One method of recovering the <strong>hottest metals, nickel and cobalt, is to extract the minerals from wastewater</strong>. Guess what, DeNora has the technologies and products in place. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The company&#8217;s Titanium DSA Anodes help recover the minerals + refine precious  metals (gold, silver), recover copper from bleed streams and valuable metals from industrial wastewater</span></strong>.</li>
<li>The company also makes products that help clean and sanitise critical facilities such as hospitals and laboratories, among other regular uses.</li>
<li>The parent company <strong>already owns technologies in the renewable batteries sector, which is extremely hot these days</strong>. The R&amp;D R&amp;D focus is on:
<ul>
<li>pure flow batteries (hydrogen / bromine, and other redox couples),</li>
<li>hybrid flow batteries (zinc / bromine)</li>
<li>metal / air batteries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The company also is ready with treatment of water and wastewater for municipalities</strong>. As you know, municipal water is the pits and the right government can change things around in no time &#8212; of course, with a little help from companies like DeNora.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is what DeNora India is all about. It quotes at a premium but the long term prospects are nonpareil. A must-have in your core portfolio.</p>

<ol>
<li>The company is based in the North East which should see phenomenal infrastructure development going forward. The Bharatmala,Interest subvention on affordable housing-food processing incentives, smart cities, development of new rail stations, etc., should see hectic demand for cement going forward.</li>
<li>Management is clean.</li>
<li>The company owns 5 operational subsidiary companies that are engaged in power generation, mining, tea cultivation and cement production business.Over time, it is possible that the company splits into several business divisions and makes investors rich.</li>
<li>Though the company made a profit on standalone basis in 2016-17, it ended up in a loss on consolidated basis. But it did make a cash profit &#8211; check the financials below.<br />
<img class="alignnone wp-image-1025 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Barak-Valley-Financials.png" alt="Buy Barak Valley Cements" width="704" height="566" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Barak-Valley-Financials.png 704w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Barak-Valley-Financials-300x241.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px" /></li>
<li>The company owns a cement brand (Valley Strong cement) whose equity is fast appreciating.</li>
<li>During the last year, the company has increased its cement production capacity from 750 TPD Cement to 1000 TPD because of high demand.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_East_policy_(India)">Government of India&#8217;s Look East</a> policy should witness infrastructure investments pouring into the North East regions and Barak valley is one of the leading cement producers out there.</li>
<li>One of the major raw materials, limestone, is sourced from the company&#8217;s subsidiary. This gives the company an added edge.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">There are issues facing the company &#8211; low margins and losses from the power business. The first issue will be fixed as demand is set to increase. Power losses are reducing and over time, as electrification catches speed, will convert into profits.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Another bugbear for the company is it&#8217;s debt &#8211; 56 crores (long term and short term). However, the company has expanded this year and the rising cement demand, or a new equity investor, should help them repay the new loan in quick time.</span></span>The company has invested  in and loaned about 52 crores to its power subsidiary where production has stalled because of non availability of raw material. In addition, the company has provided guarantees worth about 31 crores for it. This article is based on the assumption that raw material supplies will get better over time and that the power unit will be able to repay all its obligations.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><br />
</span></li>
<li>Promoter holds 57% of equity capital, and that is a good sign.</li>
<li>The net cash flow from operations was +22 crores, and the investment in capacity addition worked out to 31 crores.</li>
<li>The cash/cheques in hand at the end of the year were about 7 crores against  crores last year, a healthy sign.<br />
<h4>Barak Valley Cements is a slow burner. It is not a &#8220;phataka&#8221; stock that will go flying off. People with patience should keep tabs on its power project and future orders and perhaps consider investing in it with a time horizon of 3 years.</h4>
<p><strong>Discl: No interest</strong></li>

<p>Stock prices of quality brokerages have gone through the roof and are refusing to look back and these keep climbing higher.</p>
<p>IIFL is 618 (FV2, EPS 5), MOSL is 1458 (FV1, EPS 6) &#8212; you name it, every quality brokerage stock is available at stratospheric and almost unreasonable valuations. Yet, there are takers for brokerage companies because financialization of savings will ensure that brokerages continue to grow at a healthy pace.</p>
<p>Now, in this scenario, wouldn&#8217;t you just love to invest in a quality brokerage stock that has national exposure and is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>priced between 180 and 190, has an EPS of Rs 22, FV of 10</strong></span>, and is engaged in the following verticals?:</p>
<p>Stock Broking<br />
Commodity Broking<br />
Merchant Banking (company has managed 5 IPOs already)<br />
Insurance (not yet gained traction)<br />
NBFC<br />
Financial Training Institute (yet to fly)<br />
Online Discount Brokerage Trading (Like Zerodha/SAMCO).</p>
<p>Of course you would. No one would want to miss out on such a stock.</p>
<p>And that stock is <strong><a href="https://www.swastika.co.in">Swastika Investmart Ltd</a></strong></p>
<p>To justify my recommendation I just have one question to ask you:</p>
<p>Suppose Zerodha announces an IPO. Wouldn&#8217;t you expect a minimum price of Rs 300-500/share?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you would.</p>
<p>Now hear this &#8211; Swastika Investmart has already developed an online discount brokerage trading tool &#8211; <strong><a href="https://tradingbells.com/">Trading Bells</a></strong>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-916 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/swas2.png" alt="Trading Bells - Swastika Investmart" width="1348" height="649" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/swas2.png 1348w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/swas2-300x144.png 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/swas2-768x370.png 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/swas2-1024x493.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1348px) 100vw, 1348px" /></p>
<p>The company is spearheaded by a very dynamic individual, Sunil Nyati, who has pulled out stops to ensure that Swastika keeps up with technological changes and becomes a national brand.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://reports.swastika.co.in/InvestorRelation/RE2408201721ae0.pdf">Please read the annual report to read through the financials, business model, director&#8217;s commentary and then make </a>a decision</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure: I own some stocks that I picked up today (12 Oct).</strong></p>
