<p>The best thing about this setup is that you can have a long list of stocks and apply your favorite technicals to each stock with the click of a mouse.</p>
<h2>STEP 1: DISCOVER STOCKS BY ANALYZING OI DATA</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/market-iq/how-to-analyze-open-interest-data-and-generate-profitable-swing-trades/">You&#8217;ll need to learn how to do this and here&#8217;s an article on the subject.</a></strong></p>
<p>Make a list of stocks that look interesting based on Open Interest data. I compiled a sample list based on OI data of 8/6/18 EOD, and am assuming that you know by now how to analyze OI data.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/high-OI-stocks.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2668" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/high-OI-stocks.jpg" alt="how to analyze NSE OI data" width="976" height="864" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/high-OI-stocks.jpg 976w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/high-OI-stocks-300x266.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/high-OI-stocks-768x680.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px" /></a></p>
<p>So, a list of bullish stocks (I&#8217;ve taken about 9+% OI along with a rise in price and volume to be high-probability bullish) across three sectors are:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>IGL, GAIL, Reliance, Indian Bank, Bajaj Finance, Star (Strides Shasun), Wockhardt Pharma.</strong></span></p>
<p>So we now have a sample list of stocks that could do well on Monday. These are the stocks that we must watch on Monday morning and take a chance based on their charts.</p>
<p>Note that this is just a sample list and you probably can figure out more stocks after analyzing all the sectors.</p>
<p>Now remember this: OI keeps changing and therefore you must have it open while you trade. You also must check how it keeps changing and bring new stocks (bullish or bearish) under your radar.</p>
<p>Typically you can start checking OI data from 10 AM onwards and check every 15 minutes or so for changes.</p>
<p>Right, now let&#8217;s check the Options Chain of any one of the shortlisted stocks.</p>
<h2>STEP 2: ANALYZE THE OPTIONS CHAIN DATA</h2>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/options/how-to-analyze-call-and-put-writing-and-predict-trends/"><strong>You will need to learn how to analyze Call and Put Writing signals and this article will help.</strong></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve analyzed the Star (Strides Shasun) options chain and here&#8217;s what it looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/options-OI.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2671" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/options-OI.jpg" alt="options for intra day trades" width="1017" height="509" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/options-OI.jpg 1017w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/options-OI-300x150.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/options-OI-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1017px) 100vw, 1017px" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my analysis:</p>
<p>The stock is at 357.</p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> Call writers are squaring up their positions at 360CE 28 June 2018. You can see OI for that CE is down by 10,200. This implies that the writers are afraid to short the 360CE <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and therefore the chances of the stock moving higher look bright</strong></span>.</p>
<p><strong>(b) </strong>Call writers are happy about selling 380CE, 400CE and higher CEs for the same expiry implying that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they don&#8217;t see the stock moving beyond 380-400 up to 28 June</strong></span>.</p>
<p><strong>(c) </strong>Put writers are unafraid of writing 360 and below PEs, and you can also see that most Put buyers have lost money (while most CE buyers have made money). This implies thatÂ <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the writers don&#8217;t see the stock falling much from current levels up to 28 June</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, Star or Strides Shasun looks like a bullish trade in the short term (BTST to 4-5 days). Of course, with a strict stop loss.</p>
<p>Now, we have a probable trades for Monday and so set up the charts.</p>
<h2>STEP 3: SET UP THE CHARTS</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s make a list of all the stocks mentioned above to check on the charts on Monday.</p>
<p>Open <strong><a href="https://in.investing.com/">Investing.com</a></strong>, and sign in to your free account.</p>
<p>Hover the mouse over your Name in the member bar at the top and choose &#8220;Portfolio&#8221; from the drop down.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Investing.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2674" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Investing.jpg" alt="how to setup for a day trade" width="847" height="358" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Investing.jpg 847w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Investing-300x127.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Investing-768x325.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p>
<p>Once you are in the portfolio section, enter the stocks you have selected.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/investing-portfolio-charts.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2675" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/investing-portfolio-charts.jpg" alt="how to set up portfolio on charts" width="986" height="541" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/investing-portfolio-charts.jpg 986w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/investing-portfolio-charts-300x165.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/investing-portfolio-charts-768x421.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/investing-portfolio-charts-120x67.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px" /></a></p>
<p>Now click on any one symbol. I&#8217;m clicking on Strides Shasun as it is used as an an example in this post.</p>
<p>Now click on the &#8220;Charts&#8221; tab and it will open the chart for the first stock inn the list.</p>
<p>Expand the chart to full screen mode.</p>
<p>Apply the indicators suggested in our trade setup (Ichimoku, Supertrend, 20-50 0r 13-48 EMA, MACD).</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/a-live-trade-setup-that-can-generate-super-profits/">Also read up our trade setup to understand how a combination of this indicators work</a></strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trade-setup-multiple-stocks.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2676" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trade-setup-multiple-stocks.jpg" alt="day trading setup" width="986" height="481" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trade-setup-multiple-stocks.jpg 986w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trade-setup-multiple-stocks-300x146.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trade-setup-multiple-stocks-768x375.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px" /></a></p>
<p>Notice that all the stocks that you have added in the portfolio get featured on the right.</p>
<p>You can add as many stocks as you like and keep deleting stocks that no longer interest you.</p>
<h2>STEP 4: ANALYZE THE CHARTS</h2>
<p>As an example I&#8217;ve analyzed Strides Shasun 1-Hour chart as this period is ideal for a swing trade analysis.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strides-chart.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2677" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strides-chart.jpg" alt="how to analyze 1 hour charts" width="1358" height="661" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strides-chart.jpg 1358w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strides-chart-300x146.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strides-chart-768x374.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strides-chart-1024x498.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1358px) 100vw, 1358px" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;re my observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Supertrend indicated a buy at 358 and the stock hit 370+ before reacting back to 357. In any case, SuperTrend gives good entries but is late on exits.</li>
<li>The 20 EMA is still below 50 EMA and this is not a bullish sign.</li>
<li>The price is below the Ichimoku cloud, base lines and the EMAs. This data implies that the stock is in a downtrend.</li>
<li>The 1-Day and 1-Week charts too suggest that the stock is in a bear grip.</li>
<li>The MACD line is drooping as well. Not a good sign.</li>
<li>The Options Chain, on the other hand, indicates bullishness and the possibility of the stock hitting between 360-380 in the short run.</li>
<li>The OI data too is bullish.</li>
<li><strong>The charts are contrasting with the Options and OI data</strong>. Typically, the action starts in the derivatives before hitting the cash market.</li>
<li>So, while it makes sense watching Strides Shashun on the charts, it also makes sense to try a long strangle in the options by buyingÂ  PE and CE at ITM (In The Money) prices. This is because Strides Shasun looks very volatile give the divergent views of the derivatives and the charts data. <a href="https://bullbull.in/options/long-strangle-options-strategy-for-volatile-stocks/">This post helps you understand what a long strangle is</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>STEP 5: USING THIS SETUP</h2>
<ol>
<li>Revise the setup at the end of day, before every trading day.</li>
<li>Be ready with list of stocks at 9.15 AM and by then you should know the stocks with the highest potential to move either way.</li>
<li>Start checking the OI and Options Chain data every 15 minutes starting from 10.30 AM for OI and 10 AM for the Options data.</li>
<li>Keep adding or deleting stocks to the Investing.com portfolio per your analyses.</li>
<li>Keep analysing charts by switching between stocks. Additionally you can set up alerts per stock so that you know when stock prices touch your target.</li>
<li>Repeat.Perform a few paper trades to get a hang of this style. Good luck.</li>
</ol>

<p>This guide will help you tell with a large degree of certainty that the trade you are about to enterÂ  into has a good chance of succeeding.</p>
<p>Before you start, <a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/a-live-trade-setup-that-can-generate-super-profits/"><strong>please read our trade setup that can help you generate profits</strong></a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m writing this post in response to a query on &#8220;why Shankara Building Products is falling?&#8221; on our Mumbai Whatsapp group.</p>
<p>I started analyzing the stock and was surprised to see that our trade setup had generated a sell call at 1830.</p>
<p>But that got me thinking.</p>
<p>If our trade setup generates a sell or a buy call for a particular period (minutes, hours, day or week), what should a trader do to ensure that the signal has more chances of succeeding than failing.</p>
<p>This post will help you ensure just that.</p>
<p><strong>So, after you identify a stock, here is what you should do:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>KNOW THAT THE ORDER THAT YOU SHOULD CHECK CHARTS IS</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a. 1-Hour Chart</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>b. 1-Day Chart</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>c. 1-Week Chart</strong></span></p>
<p>But the significance of each time period is explained in reverse order for better understanding.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 1: LOOK AT THE WEEKLY CHART FOR THE BIG PICTURE</strong></p>
<p>The weekly charts present the big picture that generally holds good for the medium term. This is the first chart you must check to know the general trend.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2534" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-1.jpg" alt="how to read weekly charts" width="1341" height="634" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-1.jpg 1341w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-1-300x142.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-1-768x363.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-1-1024x484.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1341px) 100vw, 1341px" /></a></p>
<p>The analysis, if you have read our trade setup, is easy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shankara Building Products was in an uptrend but it broke this week &#8211; actually today (31 May 2018).</li>
<li>Â ST signaled a downtrend</li>
<li>Â Price fell below Ichimoku and 13D and 48D EMAs.</li>
<li>The MACD line fell below the Signal line above the Zero line which is another bearish signal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, the trader will ask that the trade setup gave a sell signal on the most crucial day (31 May 2018), and therefore what use if the trade setup.</p>
<p>Right, let&#8217;s now move to the 1 day charts of the same stock.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 2: LOOK AT THE DAILY CHART FOR THE SHORT-TERM PICTURE</strong></p>
<p>The DAILY charts present the short term pictureÂ  and you must check this immediately after checking the big picture.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2536" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-2.jpg" alt="how to read 1 day charts" width="1341" height="595" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-2.jpg 1341w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-2-300x133.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-2-768x341.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-2-1024x454.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1341px) 100vw, 1341px" /></a></p>
<p>The analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li>Â ST signaled a downtrend today (31-5-18)</li>
<li>Â Price fell below Ichimoku cloud supports and the 13D and 48D EMAs. The Ichimoku cloud is also turning red.</li>
<li>The MACD line fell below the Signal line above the Zero line when the stock was 1890. The interpretation is that the MACD crossover should be considered as an alert, but maybe not a full blown trade signal because at that time there was no confirmation by other indicators.</li>
</ol>
<p>Right, let&#8217;s now move to the 1 Hour charts of the same stock, WHICH ARE USED TO DECIDE WHETHER TO ENTER INTO A TRADE.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 3: LOOK AT THE HOURLY CHART TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOU SHOULD ENTER INTO A TRADE</strong></p>
<p>The HOURLY chart signals should be used to enter into a trade present the short term pictureÂ  and you must check this immediately after checking the big picture.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2538" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-3.jpg" alt="how to read hourly charts" width="1341" height="595" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-3.jpg 1341w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-3-300x133.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-3-768x341.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-3-1024x454.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1341px) 100vw, 1341px" /></a></p>
<p>The analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li>Â ST, EMA and MACD signaled a sell at 1825 on 24-5-18.</li>
<li>Â Price fell below Ichimoku cloud supports and the 13D and 48D EMAs on 25 and 26 May 2018. The Ichimoku cloud also turned red.</li>
<li>The MACD signaled a sell around 1820 on 25-5-18.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOW LET&#8217;S READ THE CHARTS IN REVERSE ORDER:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>On 24-5-18 the 1 Hour charts signaled a SELL. This was confirmed on 25th and 26th.</li>
<li>Going back, the 1Day MACD signaled a sell on the charts at 1890. The price also started breaking the 13 Day EMA on 25-5-18.</li>
<li>On the weekly charts, before 31-5-18, Shankara Buildcon was in an uptrend.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>THEREFORE, at best, in the period between 24-5-18 and 30-5-18, Shankara Buildcon made for a STBT candidate because the weekly chart was in an uptrend.</strong></p>
<p><strong>However, if you held the stock, all the signals said that you should book profits at least on 24-5-18 when the price was 1820.</strong></p>
<p><strong>At the time of writing this article, Shankara Buildcon is at 1697 after having tested 1427.Â  Had you sold at 1820 per our trade setup, you would have made anywhere between 130 and 400 bucks a share within 7 days.Â </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If at the end of the day (today on 31-5-18) the weekly chart reverses the downtrend, you can always change your strategy.</strong></span></p>
<p>And this is exactly what happened. Check the chart. The weekly period reversed from the downtrend:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2543" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-4.jpg" alt="how to accurately read charts" width="1346" height="599" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-4.jpg 1346w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-4-300x134.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-4-768x342.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-4-1024x456.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1346px) 100vw, 1346px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>This is how you check chart periods and determine if a stock is good enough for a trade.</strong></p>

<p>It will help you discover trending stocks, analyze their charts and then enter into an intraday trade that can hold good for the very short term to up to 6 weeks.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start:</p>
<p><strong>A: SET UP A SCREENER</strong></p>
<p>I use <a href="https://chartink.com/screener/ema-golden-cross-1">Chartink</a>, but you can use any screener of your choice.</p>
<p>The criteria used is a variant of the Golden Cross that many traders follow.</p>
<p>The Screener I have set up triggers a call when the 13 Day EMA crosses above the 48 Day EMA.</p>
<p>Yes, it is a very simple screener because the thorough analysis is done on the charts.</p>
<p><strong>B. SIGNAL VALIDITY</strong></p>
<p>The signal holds good mostly for intraday trades but can work out for short term trades.</p>
<p>For example, I had tweeted about Godrej Consumer Products at 1103 a few days back and L&amp; T (1360)/Indian Hotels (141)/BSE (832) a day ago. All these stocks were discovered using this scanner along with <strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/market-iq/how-to-analyze-open-interest-data-and-generate-profitable-swing-trades/">reading OI data</a></strong>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Track Godrej Consumer Products tomorrow on the charts.. it is likely that it will break resistance if markets are steady or up. The chart is #3 out of 4 charts. <a href="https://t.co/OuIliLiEjp">pic.twitter.com/OuIliLiEjp</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Sunil Tinani (@TheBullBull) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBullBull/status/999310115969949697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Track L&amp;T, BSE, Indian Hotels on charts using our trade setup<a href="https://t.co/6j6csgqo1z">https://t.co/6j6csgqo1z</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Sunil Tinani (@TheBullBull) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBullBull/status/1000972292602511361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><strong>On 29-5-18</strong>: Godrej Consumer hit 1143 , L&amp;T jumped to 1420, Indian Hotels 148 and BSE continues to languish.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><strong>If you see profits intra day, you should book. If you are carrying your position forward, you must work with strict stop losses.</strong></span></p>
<p>Note that in some cases the signal can hold good even for the medium and long term, but that will hold true for 2 out of 10 stocks. Therefore, it is best to use it for intraday trades extending it to a short term trade only if you are 100% convinced.</p>
<p><strong>C. WHAT TIME TO START SCREENING</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can start at 9.20 to 9.30 AM to catch early trends.</strong></p>
<p>I scanned at 9.20 AM and got the following stocks:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2496" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery1.jpg" alt="how to pick stocks" width="958" height="254" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery1.jpg 958w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery1-300x80.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery1-768x204.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" /></a></p>
<p>Out of the stocks screened, 4 were down and Remsons had hit the UC, leaving us with India Glycols.</p>
<p>I tweeted about the stock just to keep track:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Track (watch on charts or do a paper trade)</p>
<p>India Glycols</p>
<p>&mdash; Sunil Tinani (@TheBullBull) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBullBull/status/1001309975984001024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>At 9.30 AM I ran another scan and got the following trends:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2498" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery2.jpg" alt="how to discover trending stocks" width="955" height="219" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery2.jpg 955w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery2-300x69.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery2-768x176.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px" /></a></p>
<p>So at 9.30 AM, I now have 3 stocks to track:</p>
<p>India Glycols, Bodal Chemicals and to a lesser extent GHCL. This is because the volumes in GHCL are not significant enough.</p>
<p>Armed with this information let&#8217;s do a chart check:</p>
<p><strong>D. CHART CHECK</strong></p>
<p>We should do three checks:</p>
<p>One Hour &#8211; To determine if the stock is a buy</p>
<p>One Day &#8211; to determine the short term trend</p>
<p>One Week &#8211; to determine the overall trend</p>
<p>Now before you check the charts, <strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/a-live-trade-setup-that-can-generate-super-profits/">please read this article</a> </strong>and set up the following indicators:</p>
<p>a. Supertrend<br />
b. Ichimoku<br />
c. MACD</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s analyze each pick per time period:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2500" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery3.jpg" alt="how to read one hour charts" width="1346" height="659" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery3.jpg 1346w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery3-300x147.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery3-768x376.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery3-1024x501.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1346px) 100vw, 1346px" /></a></p>
<p>On the one hour charts, all three stocks are trending up and the ST has signaled a buy for all of them yesterday.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2501" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery4.jpg" alt="how to be a stock picker" width="1346" height="659" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery4.jpg 1346w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery4-300x147.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery4-768x376.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery4-1024x501.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1346px) 100vw, 1346px" /></a></p>
<p>On the one day charts, Bodal and GHCL are a clear buy. India Glycols is a sell but if you look at the MACD indicator, you will see that the MACD line is about to cross the Signal Line from below the Zero Line, which if it does, it will be an extremely bullish signal.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would not consider India Glycols to be in a bear grip. Now let&#8217;s move on t the weekly charts.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/how-to-draw-a-trendline-a-step-by-step-guide/"><strong>You may want to read this article before analyzing the weekly period charts</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2502" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery5.jpg" alt="become an expert stock picker" width="1346" height="659" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery5.jpg 1346w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery5-300x147.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery5-768x376.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery5-1024x501.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1346px) 100vw, 1346px" /></a></p>
<p>Since I can draw trendlines in my sleep, I don&#8217;t have to draw them here to know that all three stocks are in a medium-to-long-term uptrend. However you should draw trendlines for learning purposes.</p>
<p>So our chart analysis is good for all three stocks and</p>
<p><strong>E. RESULTS (AT 11.18 AM)</strong></p>
<p>Let us assume we took positions in all the three stocks at the rate we were alerted</p>
<p>The alert for INDIA GLYCOLS was generated at 533 (see image above). It touched 541 and is currently at 532.</p>
<p>The alert for BODAL was generated at 136.60 (see image above). It touched 140 and is currently at 136.90.</p>
<p>The alert for GHCL was generated at 282.55 (see image above). It touched 287 and is currently at 284.50.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #008000;"><strong>ALL THREE RESULTS GENERATED GAINS SO LONG PROFITS WERE BOOKED INTRA DAY!</strong></span></p>
<p>This is why I have suggested quick entries and exits and preferably booking intra day gains even though the stocks look good for a short term hold based on their daily and weekly charts.</p>

This is if you are going long.</p>
<p>You also can short, but please work with strict stop losses and be quick with your trades. Try ad book out intra day.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If your idea is to use this strategy for intra day trading, it will NOT work.</strong></span></p>
<p>So be ready for that.</p>
<p><strong>ESSENTIAL READING FOR WANNABE SWING TRADERS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Before swing trading, you will have to learn how to analyze open interest data. <a href="https://bullbull.in/market-iq/how-to-analyze-open-interest-data-and-generate-profitable-swing-trades/"><strong>Here is a guide that will help</strong></a>.</li>
<li>You also will have to learn how the MACD works. <a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/how-to-use-the-macd-indicator-for-spotting-momentum-and-trend/"><strong>Here is a MACD indicator guide</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Finally, I urge you to glance through a trading setup that can help you generate profits. <a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/a-live-trade-setup-that-can-generate-super-profits/"><strong>Here is the post</strong></a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please read and absorb all the materials before going any further.</p>
<p><strong>UNDERSTANDING CHART TIME FRAMES USED FOR SWING TRADING</strong></p>
<p>A swing trader typically checks 3 time frames:</p>
<ol>
<li>ONE WEEK for understanding overall trend <em>(time period to check &#8211; 4-5 months)</em></li>
<li>ONE DAY for understanding short term trendsÂ <em>(time period to check &#8211; 5-6 weeks)</em></li>
<li>ONE HOUR for entering into tradesÂ <em>(time period to check &#8211; 3-4 weeks)</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>SUGGESTED TECHNICAL INDICATORS</strong></p>
<p>I use the following indicators:</p>
<p><strong>a. Ichimoku Cloud</strong></p>
<p><strong>b. Supertrend</strong></p>
<p><strong>c. MACD</strong></p>
<p>You can set up these on the charts at Investing.com or elsewhere, or you can work with any indicators that you are comfortable with. There are no hard and fast rules.</p>
<p>The suggested indicators have been discussed in the reading material prescribed above.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT&#8217;S THE RIGHT TIME TO START FIGURING OUT POTENTIAL STOCKS?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m assuming you have read the articles posted above. Without reading or understanding those, you will not be able to figure out how to identify stocks that make for good swing trades.</p>
<p><strong>In Choppy Markets</strong>: About 12.30 PM to 1 PM is a good enough time because trends take time to stabilize</p>
<p><strong>In Trending Markets</strong>: You can start as early as 10.30 AM to 11 AM</p>
<p>You also MUST check EOD Open Interest Data which gives you a clearer and better picture.</p>
<p>Last evening I came across heavy OI + Volumes buildup in Godrej Consumer Products and tweeted about it:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Track Godrej Consumer Products tomorrow on the charts.. it is likely that it will break resistance if markets are steady or up. The chart is #3 out of 4 charts. <a href="https://t.co/OuIliLiEjp">pic.twitter.com/OuIliLiEjp</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Sunil Tinani (@TheBullBull) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBullBull/status/999310115969949697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>At EOD yesterday the CMP was 1101.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it makes for a good swing trade because of high OI buildup.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s check the OI now at 1.30 PM on 24-5-18</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/swing-trade2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2428" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/swing-trade2.jpg" alt="how to use OI data in swing trading" width="803" height="56" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/swing-trade2.jpg 803w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/swing-trade2-300x21.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/swing-trade2-768x54.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></a></p>
<p>The price is up 0.34%, OI is the same as yesterday, and volumes have yet to pick up.</p>
<p>However, it is 1.30 PM now and we still have 2 hours to go. Moreover, the price has appreciated from 1101 to 1108. Therefore Godrej Consumer Products is a conviction pick for a swing trade.</p>

Here&#8217;s how:</p>
<h2><strong>COMPONENTS OF MACD</strong></h2>
<p>First things first, let&#8217;s understand the components:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MACD-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2389" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MACD-1.jpg" alt="how to analyze MACD" width="1200" height="568" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MACD-1.jpg 1200w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MACD-1-300x142.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MACD-1-768x364.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MACD-1-1024x485.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li>The MACD (blue) line is calculated thus: 12 Period EMA (minus) 26 Period EMA</li>
<li>The Signal (red) line is a 9-Period EMA of the MACD line</li>
<li>The Histogram calculates the difference between the MACD and Signal lines</li>
<li>The Zero line (note the &#8220;0&#8221; value on your right).</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>HOW TO INTERPRET MACD</strong></h2>
<p><strong>A. GENERAL INTERPRETATION</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>When the MACD line crosses above the Signal line, the trend is bullish and this is a buy signal</li>
<li>When the MACD line crosses below the Signal line, the trend is bearish and this is a sell signal</li>
<li>When the lines are above the Zero Line the trend is bullish and when these are below the Zero line, the trend is bearish</li>
<li>When the histogram lines lengthen (either way) the momentum (either way) gathers steam</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>B. FORECASTING SHORT TERM TRENDS (V. V IMPORTANT)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MACD-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2391" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MACD-3.jpg" alt="MACD Line Crosses Signal Line" width="1343" height="610" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MACD-3.jpg 1343w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MACD-3-300x136.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MACD-3-768x349.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MACD-3-1024x465.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1343px) 100vw, 1343px" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>When the MACD Line crosses above the Signal Line from BELOW the Zero Line, it is a POWERFUL BULLISH signal. <span style="color: #008000;">USE IT TO TRADE IN ANY TYPE OF MARKET (Choppy, bear, bull).</span></strong></li>
<li><strong>When the MACD Line crosses below the Signal Line from ABOVE the Zero Line, it is a POWERFUL BEARISH signal.Â <span style="color: #008000;">USE IT TO TRADE IN ANY TYPE OF MARKET (Choppy, bear, bull).</span></strong></li>
<li><strong>When the MACD Line crosses above the Signal Line from ABOVE the Zero Line, it is a BULLISH signal. <span style="color: #008000;">It will give you great results when the trend is bullish.</span></strong></li>
<li><strong>When the MACD Line crosses below the Signal Line from BELOW the Zero Line, it is a BEARISH signal. <span style="color: #008000;">It will give you great results when the trend is bearish.</span></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You can see in the chart how the Nifty spiked and crashed when these lines crossed above and below the Zero lines.</p>
<h2><strong>SETTING THE PERIOD</strong></h2>
<p><strong>FOR SHORT TERM TRADERS</strong></p>
<p>FOR A RELIABLE MACD SIGNAL, USE THE 1-HOUR CHART. The image above proves that a 1-Hour chart can really leverage the MACD</p>
<p>I recommend that Intraday traders should use the 1-hour period in choppy markets and the 15-minute or 30-minute period when the trend is certain. These periods are more reliable.</p>
<h2><strong>CASE STUDY: MACD ON 22-5-18</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MACD-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2394" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MACD-4.jpg" alt="How to interpret MACD" width="1361" height="613" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MACD-4.jpg 1361w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MACD-4-300x135.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MACD-4-768x346.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MACD-4-1024x461.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1361px) 100vw, 1361px" /></a></p>
<p>This is how you work the MACD by and large. Many folks jump into a trade at the first opportunity without setting the right period or acting on false cues such as when the Histogram draws a line above the zero line.</p>
<p>Ideally you should use the MACD for trend spotting and then measuring the momentum after the trend proves true.</p>
<p>All the tools that you need to interpret the MACD are right up there. Give it a shot and do some paper trades and see how it goes.</p>

<p>Typically, traders use stochastic to buy when it gets into the oversold zone and sell when the stochastic is in the overbought zone. OR, traders look for divergence (rising price-falling stochastic for shorting/ falling price-rising stochastic for buying).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Both techniques are wrong and can result in losses.</strong></span></p>
<p>Here is how you should use the Stochastic:</p>
<h3>What is the Stochastic Indicator?</h3>
<p>Stochastic takes the following values:</p>
<p><strong>Close (per Candle)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Highest High (per Candle)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lowest Low (per Candle)</strong></p>
<p>Then it divides (close &#8211; lowest low) <strong>by</strong> (highest high-lowest low) and then applies a 3-Day Simple Moving Average to the product.</p>
<p>Basically it establishes a relationship between the lowest, highest and close per candle, and by this relationship, it tries to ascertain the momentum of a stock.</p>
<p>By default, Stochastic is set toÂ  fourteen periods.</p>
<p>That means, if you work with a 15-minute chart, Stochastic reflects fourteen 15-minute candles; if you use 1-Day chart, then the indicator reflects fourteen 1-Day candles, and so on.</p>
<h3>Setting Up Stochastic</h3>
<p>Check the image below. I have removed the SMA (changed it from 3 to 1) as a single Stochastic line will suffice. You can set it up this way or follow the traditional 2-line stochastic, which will increase monitoring activity (you have to check stochastic line crossovers + monitor the price charts and other indicators.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2320" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-2.jpg" alt="how to analyze stochastic" width="1365" height="638" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-2.jpg 1365w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-2-300x140.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-2-768x359.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-2-1024x479.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></a></p>
<p>Now, along with the Stochastic, also set up the 50-Day Moving Average and the 200-Day Moving Average, as I have done (check image above).</p>
<h3>How To Work The Stochastic Indicator</h3>
<p><strong>STEP ONE</strong>: <strong>Set up the 1-Day Chart</strong></p>
<p>Check whether the price is above or below the 50- and 200-Day Moving Averages.</p>
<p><strong>If the price is above these Moving Averages, it implies that the trend is up.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>In such cases you should buy the stock or Index when the Stochastic is oversold.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>If the price is below the Moving Averages, it implies that the trend is down.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>In such cases you should short the stock or Index when the Stochastic is overbought.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s 18-5-18 and the time is 11.35. Let&#8217;s check what&#8217;s happening to the Nifty at the moment.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2323" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-3.jpg" alt="how to set up stochastic" width="1365" height="638" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-3.jpg 1365w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-3-300x140.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-3-768x359.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-3-1024x479.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the Reading:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nifty is above the 50-Day and 200-Day Moving Averages. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This implies Nifty is an uptrend</strong></span>.</li>
<li>Stochastic is around 15. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is oversold</strong></span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Should you buy the Nifty here.</p>
<p>Well, if you are a trader, you should NOT follow the 1-day chart for shorting intra-day.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But the 1-Day chart has given you an overall picture &#8211; that the Nifty is in an uptrend and that you must consider that fact before making an intra-day decision</strong></span> (implying that if you short Nifty, you should make quick exits, and that if you are going long, then you can hold positions for some time (maybe a few days)).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Typically, you&#8217;d like to use the Stochastic on a 1-hour chart for a reliable trade. So let&#8217;s do that now. (Some traders use the 15- and 30-minute candles, and it&#8217;s entirely up to you what to use.)</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>STEP TWO</strong>: <strong>You know the Big Picture, NowÂ Set up the 1-Hour Chart</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2326" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-4.jpg" alt="how to analyze stochastic" width="1365" height="638" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-4.jpg 1365w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-4-300x140.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-4-768x359.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-4-1024x479.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></a></p>
<p>What do we see here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nifty has fallen below its 50-Day MA (<strong>Bearish</strong>)</li>
<li>It is just below the 200-Day MA, a bad sign (<strong>Bearish</strong>)</li>
<li>Stochastic is 6.5 (<strong>hugely oversold</strong>)</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>So, in my opinion, Nifty is not a buy even though it is oversold.</strong></span></p>
<p>But then what should you do in such cases!!!???!!!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what.</p>
<p><strong>STEP ONE</strong>: <strong>DRAW A TRENDLINE</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/how-to-draw-a-trendline-a-step-by-step-guide/">If you don&#8217;t know how to draw one, read this article</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2327" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-5.jpg" alt="how to use stochastic" width="1365" height="638" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-5.jpg 1365w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-5-300x140.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-5-768x359.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-5-1024x479.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve drawn a trendline on the Nifty 1-Hour Chart and the reading is:</p>
<ol>
<li>The trendline perfectly reconciles (meets) with the 200-Day Moving Average.</li>
<li>The last candles highest high is 10,655.</li>
<li>The Nifty is below the 200-day MA and the trendline too, indicating bearishness.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Therefore, I would wait for the Nifty to convincingly cross above 10655 (highest high of last candle), wait Stochastic to turn and wait a whole green candle to cross the 200-Day MA and the trendline before initiating a buy.</strong></h2>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Until then I would wait.</strong></span></p>
<p>This is how you can use the Stochastic. Perform some paper trades on the Index and FNO stocks and see how it works for you before you practice it in real life.</p>
<h2>REALITY CHECK AT 3.25 PM</h2>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2332" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-7.jpg" alt="STOCHASTIC LEARNING IN LIVE TRADE" width="1365" height="638" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-7.jpg 1365w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-7-300x140.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-7-768x359.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stochastic-7-1024x479.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></a></p>
<p>This is the situation as at 3.25 PM</p>
<ol>
<li>Though Stochastic was oversold during the day, it did not become a buy.</li>
<li>Though there was divergence (Stochastic rising, price falling) it still did not become a buy.</li>
</ol>
<p>This validates our article. Absolute proof of concept.</p>

<p>Typically, a support point represents a price at which buyers will or should buy the stock and the resistance point is when sellers will dump the stock.</p>
<p>The idea being that if a trader or investor knows the support and resistance levels, he can enter into profitable trades or book his profits or SLs.</p>
<p>There are two general rules of Support and Resistance:</p>
<p>FOR BUYERS: A stock falling to an old low is worse than a stock falling down to its old high.</p>
<p>FOR SELLERS: A stock piercing above its old prior is better than when it pierces above its old low.</p>
<p>Though you cannot time the market, learning how to tell the support and resistance levels can help you get the timing almost-right.</p>
<h3>Here&#8217;s how you discover support and resistance levels.</h3>
<p><strong>A. By Marking Highs and Lows</strong></p>
<p>In the chart above I have marked the major lows (9360, 9460, 9720, 10021, 10300 and 9956) and the highs (10135, 10470 and the all time high of 11200).</p>
<p>These are the support and resistance levels in this example. As you can see, the support of 28/9/17 of 9720 has held out so far, and even the support of 10021 was breached, and there was an immediate bounce back.</p>
<p>As far as highs are concerned, when the two highs of 10136 and 10470 were pierced, the NIFTY hit a high of 11200.</p>
<p>Currently the NIFTY is at 10618 above its resistance of 10470. So, if it falls below 10470, then the low of 10300 can hold as the support. And so on. Keep watching the levels to learn the concept.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SR1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2238" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SR1.jpg" alt="how to determine support and resistance levels" width="1348" height="638" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SR1.jpg 1348w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SR1-300x142.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SR1-768x363.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SR1-1024x485.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1348px) 100vw, 1348px" /></a></p>
<p>Now, I have created an example for a 1-day period chart.</p>
<p>Traders and swing traders should determine support and resistance levels after studying 30-minute, 1-hour and 4-hour period charts.</p>
<p>InvestorsÂ Â should determine support and resistance levels after studying 1-hour, 1-day and 1-Month period charts.</p>
<p><strong>B. By Plotting Moving Averages</strong></p>
<p>In the example below, I have plotted 4 Moving Averages on a 1-Day Period Chart</p>
<p>9-Day &#8211; <strong>10,648</strong></p>
<p>20-Day &#8211; <strong>10,551</strong></p>
<p>50-Day &#8211; <strong>10,393</strong></p>
<p>200-Day &#8211; <strong>10,283</strong></p>
<p>Nifty is at <strong>10,618</strong></p>
<p>It has crossed below the 9-Day MA but is still some distance away from the 20-Day MA. If it falls blow 10551, the next supports are at 10,393 and 10,283.</p>
<p>If it falls below 10,283, and keeps falling,, then there could be real trouble and the next support will be at 10,021 (see section A above).</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SR2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2240" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SR2.jpg" alt="how to determine support and resistance levels" width="1365" height="661" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SR2.jpg 1365w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SR2-300x145.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SR2-768x372.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SR2-1024x496.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>If you are a trader you should check MAs for support and resistance on 30-minute, 1-hour and 4-hour charts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A swing trader should checkÂ MAs for support and resistance on 1-Hour, 4-hour, and 1-day charts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Short and medium term traders can work with 1-day and Weekly charts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Long term traders should check Weekly and Month charts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>C. Trendlines</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/charts/how-to-draw-a-trendline-a-step-by-step-guide/">Before reading any further, learn how to draw trendlines here</a>.</p>
<p>Assuming you have read the article, you now know that that if a stock falls below the trendline, it has entered a bear zone, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Addition information:</p>
<p><strong>If you are a trader draw trendines on 30-minute charts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are a swing trader draw trendines on 30-minute charts 1-Hour charts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are a medium term trader draw trendines on 1-day charts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are a long term trader draw trendines on 1-week charts.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, these are my recommendations and you can chop and play around with periods that you are comfortable with.</p>
<p>This is how you can easily determine support and resistance levels.</p>

Chartists are not bothered about fundamental analysis, they are only interested in analyzing current price movements and comparing these to past data.</p>
<h3>A. Technical Analysis Assumptions</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>All news, fundamentals, results, etc., are already built into the price</strong>. Well, this may be true in steady market conditions but we are sitting on massive volatility where one bit of news can set off an explosive reaction on the charts. So, IMO, I would agree to this assumption only when the markets are more or less steady. I can cite example that support my contrarian views &#8211; for example, HEG has below average fundamentals but has zoomed up because of global disruptions. Can cite many more examples, but one will do.</li>
<li><strong>Stock prices always move in a trend, which can be short-, medium-, or long-term</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Stock prices will follow patterns/trends that they have exhibited in the past</strong>. In other words, history will repeat itself. However, in this day and age of disruption and rapid technological obsolescence, this hypothesis may not hold true in some cases.</li>
</ol>
<h3>B. About Charts</h3>
<p>You already may be familiar with how a chart looks. For the record, a stock chart plots time on the X-axis and the price on the Y-axis:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CHARTS1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2158" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CHARTS1.jpg" alt="charts school" width="1349" height="554" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CHARTS1.jpg 1349w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CHARTS1-300x123.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CHARTS1-768x315.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CHARTS1-1024x421.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1349px) 100vw, 1349px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>There are 3 types of charts (there are others too, but these three are the most commonly used):</strong></p>
<p>1. Line Chart:</p>
<p>This is how a line chart looks like and you probably have seen it. In a line chart the closing price is plotted per the time period selected and enjoined by a line.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chart-line.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2160" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chart-line.jpg" alt="how does a line chart look" width="600" height="246" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chart-line.jpg 600w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chart-line-300x123.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>2. Bar Chart</strong> &#8211; in this chart the open, close, high and low prices are represented on a bar, and each bar on the chart represents the period that you have selected. The Nifty chart above is represented in a bar chart and the green bars represent the time period in which the security closed higher and the red barsÂ represent the time period in which the security closed lower.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/BAR-CHART.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2161" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/BAR-CHART.jpg" alt="how does a bar chart look" width="546" height="194" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/BAR-CHART.jpg 546w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/BAR-CHART-300x107.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px" /></a></p>
<p>3.<strong> Candle Chart</strong></p>
<p>Similar concept as bars, but the candle formations have a lot of variety and one can forecast price movements if he knows how to read candle formations and patterns. <a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/interpreting-candlesticks-part-1-candlestick-formations/">To get started with candles, read this article</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/candlestick-formations-1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1807" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/candlestick-formations-1.png" alt="understanding candlestick formations" width="700" height="318" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/candlestick-formations-1.png 700w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/candlestick-formations-1-300x136.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<h3>C.Â  Price Trends</h3>
<p>A trend is a direction in which the prices move.</p>
<p>Many patterns are formed on a chart, and you may have heard analysts saying hings like: cup and handle, heads and shoulders, W formation, trendline, broken out of a trend, blah blah.</p>
<p>There are 3 trend directions:</p>
<p><strong>a. Uptrend</strong>: Higher highs, lower lows</p>
<p><strong>b. Downtrend:</strong> Lower highs, higher lows. Here is an image that will help you understand uptrend and downtrend on a chart:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/UP-DOWNTREND.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2166" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/UP-DOWNTREND.jpg" alt="uptrend and downtrend plotting on a chart" width="1342" height="563" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/UP-DOWNTREND.jpg 1342w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/UP-DOWNTREND-300x126.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/UP-DOWNTREND-768x322.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/UP-DOWNTREND-1024x430.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1342px) 100vw, 1342px" /></a></p>
<p><strong> c. Sideways:</strong> Also referred to as consolidation before a big move. This is the trend in which the prices remain in a range. Here is an example of Apollo Tyres moved between 160 and 245 for 3 years, and has now broken out of this consolidation phase and seems headed higher (292 now).</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/consolidation.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2167" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/consolidation.jpg" alt="consolidation phase on charts" width="1349" height="578" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/consolidation.jpg 1349w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/consolidation-300x129.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/consolidation-768x329.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/consolidation-1024x439.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1349px) 100vw, 1349px" /></a></p>

<p>Use 1 Hour candles to determine trends for swing trades.</p>
<p>Use 1 Day candles to determine trends for medium term.</p>
<p>Use 1 Week candles to determine trends for long term.</p>
<p><strong>Sub-Types of Trends</strong></p>
<p>You already know the three types of trends &#8211; up, down and sideways.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Now, these trends can last long, medium or short term</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Long term trends last for a year or more (See the Apollo Tyres chart above for the long term sideways trend).</p>
<p>Medium term trends last 1-3 months and the Nifty Chart above will help you understand these.</p>
<p>Short term trends last less than a month.</p>

<p>CCI works like the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) and warns traders when prices reach extreme zones. Its twists and turns can also be used to enter or exit from trades.</p>
<h2>How Is The Commodity Channel Index Calculated?</h2>
<div class="level2">
<p>Well, there&#8217;s much more than understanding the formula of calculating the CCI, which anyway is:</p>
</div>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cci.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2129" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cci.jpg" alt="Commodity Channel Index Calculation" width="412" height="101" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cci.jpg 412w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cci-300x74.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px" /></a></p>
<p>Well, the formula is set, and by the Commodity Channel Index period is by default set to 20. (Twenty being the periods. For example, if a chart is made up of 15 minute candles, then twenty 15-minute candle prices are used to calculated averages).</p>
<h2>Before that, know thatÂ most of the CCI movements happen between -100 and +100. Moves that exceed this channel depict extraordinary strength or weakness that can be herald forthcoming price action.</h2>
<p>AN Extremely high level indicates the stock is <strong>OVERBOUGHT</strong> while an extremely low level indicates the stock is <strong>OVERSOLD</strong>.</p>
<h2>When CCI is between the -100 and +100 range it can be interpreted as bullish when it is positive, and bearish when it is negative.</h2>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What you must know is how to calculate this default period, and whether 20 is applicable to your trading setup.</span></h2>
<p>Here is an example of VIP Industries.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s first see what the 20-Period CCI of VIP Industries tells us:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cci1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2130" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cci1.jpg" alt="how to analyze Commodity Channel Index" width="1361" height="632" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cci1.jpg 1361w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cci1-300x139.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cci1-768x357.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cci1-1024x476.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1361px) 100vw, 1361px" /></a></p>
<p>The CCI in this case has moved way beyond +100 and is kissing 274, which somehow does give the impression that it may be overbought.</p>
<p><strong>HOWEVER, THERE IS A RECENT EVENT THAT HAS OCCURRED IN VIP INDUSTRIES</strong></p>
<p>The management has started picking up fairly large quantities of the stock over the last two weeks.</p>
<p>Note that in such an event-based price action, the 20-period configuration does not hold good.</p>
<p>Here is what you do:</p>
<p>(a) Take 2 recent highs around the time of the event<br />
(b) Calculated the time period between these two highs<br />
(c) Divide the time period by 3</p>
<p>In the case of VIP industries, as you will observe in the weekly chart below, the price started spurting a week before the management got into the act.</p>
<p>Therefore, the stock has seen 2 highs <strong>AFTER THE EVENT</strong> (insider buying) within the span of 3 weekly candles. So, 3 weeks are 21 days. Divide it by 3 and you get 7.</p>
<p>As the event is recent, I have shortened the period to 6. Now here is the chart:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CC2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2132" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CC2.jpg" alt="commodity channel index period " width="1366" height="626" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CC2.jpg 1366w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CC2-300x137.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CC2-768x352.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CC2-1024x469.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px" /></a></p>
<p>CCI 20 is at 273 while CCI 6 is at 127, which is a huge variance. The 20-period CCI suggests the stock is overbought while the 6-period CCI suggests that the stock is witnessing extraordinary bullish fervor.</p>
<p>THIS IS WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO ADJUST THE CCI PERIODÂ  for stocks that ave been impacted by events.</p>
<p>ALWAYS, take the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1-year period chart</strong> </span>of any stock into consideration, check for events of the past one year and see how the prices behave, and then:</p>
<p>1. Take 2 highs or lows (in the case of bearish news, and in case you want to short the stock)<br />
2. Calculate the time period between the two highs or lows<br />
3. Divide by 3<br />
4. Apply that period to the CCI.<br />
5. If the stock has no memorable events associated to it, you can use the default CCI period (20).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all you need to know. If you have questions, please fire away.</p>

Let&#8217;s get started:</p>
<h3>GENERAL RULES</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/how-to-be-100-sure-of-a-chart-signal/">Traders MUST read this article before jumping into a trade</a></strong>. Know that once you know the big picture and the short term trend, you can use 15m and 30m candles to enter into a trade.</li>
<li>The VWAP generally equalizes with the CMP during the day, and that is the time a trader should act. If the price starts moving above the VWAP, it is bullish, and the VWAP will gradually move up to equalize with the price over the space of a few candles.</li>
<li>Investors should work with 1-hour or 1-Day charts. 1-Day charts can provide better medium term cues, while 1-hour charts provide the trend for a swing trade.</li>
<li>Use charts only for FNO stocks and Indices. Do not track illiquid stocks on charts because these can be manipulated easily.</li>
<li>This trade setup will give you about 2-3 trades on the Indices every week, and no more. For stocks, it is up to you as it depends on the number of stocks you are interested in.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>UNDERSTANDING CHART TIME FRAMESÂ </strong></p>
<p>A trader or investor typically checks 3 time frames:</p>
<ol>
<li>ONE WEEK for understanding overall trend <em>(time period to check &#8211; 4-5 months)</em></li>
<li>ONE DAY for understanding short term trendsÂ <em>(time period to check &#8211; 5-6 weeks)</em></li>
<li>ONE HOUR for entering into tradesÂ <em>(time period to check &#8211; 3-4 weeks)</em></li>
</ol>
<h3>SETTING UP THE TRADE (Updated on 31-5-18)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Log in at Investing.com</li>
<li>Search for any symbol or index.</li>
<li>Set up the following indicators:<br />
a. <strong>SuperTrend</strong> (7, 3): It alerts you when the trend changes by plotting arrows on the chart.<br />
b. <strong>VWAP</strong> (Volume Weighted Average Price): Bullish when price moves above it, and bearish otherwise.<br />
c. <strong>Ichimoku Cloud</strong>: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://bullbull.in/charts/how-to-use-the-ichimoku-cloud/">Read this post to figure out how it works</a></span>.<br />
d. <b>MACD</b>: Earlier, I worked with the Chaikin Oscillator but have found that the MACD gives a more reliable signal. <strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/how-to-use-the-macd-indicator-for-spotting-momentum-and-trend/">Read this article to learn how the MACD should be interpreted</a></strong>.<br />
e. I have added 13-DAY andÂ 48-DAY EMAs to the setup. When 13D EMA crosses the 48D EMA it is a bullish signal, and vice versa.<br />
f. Note that the images below do not contain MACD and the EMAs, but even without those, the setup works perfectly.</li>
</ol>
<h3>INTERPRETATION</h3>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Interpretation.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2112" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Interpretation.jpg" alt="technicals for beginners and intermediate traders" width="1349" height="634" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Interpretation.jpg 1349w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Interpretation-300x141.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Interpretation-768x361.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Interpretation-1024x481.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1349px) 100vw, 1349px" /></a></p>
<p>Check the numbers on the chart before reading this interpretation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Supertrend</strong> signaled a buy on 16-4-18 at 10488-10500 levels. At this point, the priced moved ferociously above the <strong>VWAP</strong>, another bullish signal. As you can observe, the <strong>VWAP</strong>Â (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the thick blue line</span>) moved up and equalized with the price after a few candles. Also, at this time the Ichimoku conversion line was above the base line, and the price moved above the conversion line, and so, we had a bullish trend confirmed by 3 signals, while the <strong>Chaikin Oscilltor</strong> suggested that money was moving out. However, the <strong>Chaikin Oscillator</strong> keeps evening out over a period of time, and as I recall, it was trending up when the other 3 signals suggested bullishness.</li>
<li>The Nifty hit a high of 10,552 and started dropping (see the big red candle).</li>
<li>Though the <strong>Supertrend</strong> indicator was still positive, the price started putting pressure on theÂ <strong>VWAP</strong>Â and on the <strong>Ichimoku Conversion</strong> line (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the thin red line</span>) and that suggested that it was time to book profits and stay on the sidelines. The <strong>Chaikin Oscillator</strong> also indicated that money was dumping the Nifty (#5).</li>
<li>The support for the Nifty existed at 10506 (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the green <strong>Supertrend</strong> line</span>)Â  and 10460 (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the first <strong>Ichimoku</strong> cloud line</span>).</li>
<li>This is explained in #3 above.</li>
</ol>
<p>INTERPRETATION REVIEW</p>
<p>It is 11.45 AM now, and I am reviewing the interpretation written at 11 AM. Here is the chart:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iNTERPRETATION-REVIEW.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2113" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iNTERPRETATION-REVIEW.jpg" alt="how to interpret technical charts" width="1343" height="563" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iNTERPRETATION-REVIEW.jpg 1343w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iNTERPRETATION-REVIEW-300x126.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iNTERPRETATION-REVIEW-768x322.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iNTERPRETATION-REVIEW-1024x429.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1343px) 100vw, 1343px" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li>At 11.45 the scenario has played out as per the interpretation above. At this time, the <strong>Supertrend</strong> is still bullish. On the bearish side, the <strong>Chaikin Oscilltor</strong> has seen substantial volume selling, the prices are below the <strong>VWAP</strong> andÂ  the <strong>Ichimoku Conversion Line</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Chaikin Oscillator</strong> also has flattened out and the last candle shows a rejection of selling. It&#8217;s 11.53 now and I see that the next candle is green, and the <strong>Chaikin Oscilltor</strong> has started rising. So at this point, I would wait to see how the price moves in relation to the VWAP and then make a decision. So, the strategy now is to sit on the sidelines and wait for a signal.</li>
<li>Know that the 1-day Nifty Candle chart is in bullish zone and therefore any shorts should not me taken home UNLESS the 1D Chart reverses.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>UPDATE ON 26 MAY 2018 AND 31 MAY 2018</strong></p>
<p>You can try out the following three indicators as well. After writing this article, I have tested these and can vouch for their effectiveness:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Supertrend</strong> (details above) (use it for entry)</li>
<li><strong>Ichimoku</strong> (use it for exits when it breaks Lead and Conversion Lines.</li>
<li><strong>MACD</strong>Â <a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/how-to-use-the-macd-indicator-for-spotting-momentum-and-trend/"><strong>Here is a MACD indicator guide</strong></a>.</li>
<li><strong>VWAP</strong> (explained above) &#8211; to learn how stock will trend.</li>
<li><strong>EMAs</strong> as explained above.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#8217;s it guys. Put this to use for both trading and investing, as suggested above. Good luck.</p>
