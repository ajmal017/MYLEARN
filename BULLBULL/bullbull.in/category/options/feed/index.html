<ol>
<li><strong>TIME:</strong> The time left up to the expiry.</li>
<li><strong>STRIKE PRICE</strong>: The price at which you are buying or selling the option.</li>
<li><strong>OPTION PREMIUM</strong>: The premium of the call or put option that you intend to trade in.</li>
<li><strong>UNDERLYING PRICE: </strong>The CMP of the Stock or Index (Underlying)</li>
<li><strong>VOLATILITY</strong>: The assumed/implied volatility of the stock/index (underlying) as calculated based on historical data.</li>
<li><strong>RATE OF INTEREST: </strong>The safe rate of interest.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Options Greeks correlate and analyze these sensitives and and Options Writers draw inferences from the analyses.</strong></p>
<p>Option Writers/Traders read the Greeks data (mainly Delta, Gamma and Theta) to enter or exit trades.</p>
<p><strong>Now before you read any more, know that there are two elements attached to each Greek:</strong></p>
<p><strong>a. What it is?</strong></p>
<p><strong>b. How is it calculated?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>The Greeks are calculated with online tools and therefore you should not bother about calculations at this moment. It is important that you understand the concept first, and then get to the calculation.</em></span></p>
<h2><strong>Concept of Options Greeks explained in plain English:</strong></h2>
<h3>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">DELTA</span> &#8211; CORRELATES OPTION PREMIUM WITH THE UNDERLYING PRICE</h3>
<p>When the price of the underlying moves up by Rs 1, its Call Option premium also moves up, while its Put Option premium falls.</p>
<p>Now, the inference is that:</p>
<p><strong>FOR CALL OPTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>When the underlying&#8217;s price moves up by Re 1, the Call Option premium can move up anywhere between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>Obviously it can&#8217;t move up above 1 or go down below 0 when the price of the underlying moves up by JUST 1 buck.</p>
<p>As per Options Greek covenants, the Delta for a call option is always POSITIVE, between 0 and 1 (or between 0 and 100) .</p>
<p><strong>This movement of the options premium in relation to the underlying price is referred to as the Delta (in this case for Call Options).</strong></p>
<p>So if the the delta for a call option is calculated by an online tool to be 0.50, it means that for that call, the premium will move up or down by 0.50 paise for every Re 1 movement in the underlying&#8217;s price. Some folks use a scale between 0 and 100, and therefore 0.50 and 50 represent the same Delta.</p>
<p><strong>FOR PUT OPTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>As per Options Greek covenants, the Delta for a call option is always NEGATIVE, between -1 and 0.</p>
<p>When the underlying&#8217;s price moves up by Re 1, the Put Option premium can fall anywhere between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>Obviously it can&#8217;t fall more than 1, or at best it can lie static by not moving (0), when the price of the underlying goes up by a buck.</p>
<p><strong>This movement of the Put options premium in relation to the underlying price is referred to as the Delta (in this case for Put Options).</strong></p>
<p>So if the Put option premium moves down by 0.30 for every Re 1 rise in the underlying CMP, the Delta is -0.30. Some folks use a scale between 0 and 100, and therefore -0.30 and -30 represent the same Delta.</p>
<p>AND, as explained above, the Delta can only be between -1 and 0 (or between -100 and 0) for a Put option.</p>
<p><strong>So we now know that the Delta for a Call Option is between 0 and 1, and between -1 and 0 for a Put Option.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SOME FEATURES OF DELTA</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If you buy an in-the-money call option, the Delta will approach 1 by expiry. This is obvious, because as expiry approaches the in-the-money options premium will more or less keep pace with the underlying&#8217;s price.</li>
<li>Conversely, the Delta for out-of-money call option will approach o by expiry.</li>
<li>If you buy an in-the-money put option, the Delta will approach -1 by expiry.</li>
<li>Conversely, the Delta for out-of-money put option will approach o by expiry.</li>
<li>The delta keeps changing. On a given day the Delta for a CE can fluctuate from 0.20 to 0.70 or from 0.50 to 0.10 very quickly, depending on how volatile a stock is.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>HOW DO OPTIONS TRADERS  USE DELTA</strong></h2>
<p>Options writers use Delta to measure their risk. For example, if an Options Writer sells a CE at 0.50 Delta and it suddenly spurts to 0.90 then his risk increases.</p>
<p>To Options Writers, the Delta also denotes the probability that an option will expire ITM. For example, if the Delta is 0.20, then there are 20% chances of that expiring in the money. Therefore, if you buy or sell naked options, you should use Delta to figure out your chance of making money.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/a-live-trade-setup-that-can-generate-super-profits/">At this point, you also must combine your reading of Delta with our trade setup</a></strong>. If our setup gives you a bullish signal, it could mean that the Delta is likely to increase.</p>
<h3>2. GAMMA &#8211; THE CORRELATION OF DELTA WITH THE UNDERLYING&#8217;S PRICE</h3>
<p>Gamma is the rate at which Delta changes based on every Re 1 fluctuation in the underlying&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>CEs have positive gamma (for every Re 1 rise in price the positive gamma gets added to the Delta, and vice ersa) while PEs have negative gamma(for every Re 1 rise in price the gamma gets deducted from the Delta, and vice versa).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s understand Gamma with the help of an example:</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say KPIT Tech is at 285 and its 28 JUNE 290 CE is selling for Rs 9.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume its delta is 0.2 and a gamma of 0.1 or 10 percent. (Note that the calculations are done by software, and these are just assumptions).</p>
<p>If the stock price moves up by Re 1 to 286, the delta will get adjusted from 0.20 to 0.30 (the Gamma of 0.10 gets added to the Delta for ever Re 1 buck jump in price, or deducted by 0.1 for every Re 1 fall in the price.</p>
<p>So Gamma accelerates with a Re 1 rise in price and reverses with the same speed with every Re 1 fall in price.</p>
<p>However, note that the Delta for a CE can move only between 0 and 1, and therefore if the underlying&#8217;s price keeps increasing or falling, the accretion to gamma will keep decreasing because the maximum limit that the Delta can hit is between 0 and 1. When the CE goes deep in the money, the Delta will equal 1 and the gamma will hit 0. Likewise (conversely) for PEs, where the Delta can only be between -1 and 0.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DO OPTIONS TRADERS  USE GAMMA</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If gamma is high for OTM CEs it means that the Delta and options premium will rise quickly with every Re 1 rise in the underlying. A bullish signal.</li>
<li>If gamma is high for OTM PEs it means that the Delta will rise quickly with every Re 1 rise in the underlying. A bearish signal.</li>
<li>Option writers get into action in the last week of expiry and start shorting OTM options in order to make premiums. They typically look for CEs and PEs with low Delta and low Gamma.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">THETA</span> &#8211; CORRELATES TIME-TO-EXPIRY WITH OPTIONS PREMIUMS</h3>
<p>Theta represents time decay. Options Writers love it, option buyers hate it.</p>
<p><strong>It tells you how much the premiums of calls and puts are expected to fall per day as the expiry draws near.</strong></p>
<p>In general, Theta for ATM and ITM options increases as expiry draws closer while Theta for deep OTM decreases as expiry nears.</p>
<h4><strong>Also, in general, volatile stocks have higher theta than non volatile stocks.</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>HOW DO OPTIONS TRADERS  USE THETA</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>Options writers write high theta options near expiry.</li>
<li>When you expect a stock to be medium term bullish but short term neutral, you can check the theta and trade a Long Calendar Spread. That is short a high theta option near expiry and buy the option for the next expiry if it has a high theta.</li>
<li>OTM options near expiry with low theta can make for a buy s long technicals suggest an uptrend, and vice versa.</li>
</ol>
<h3>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">VEGA</span> &#8211; CORRELATES OPTIONS PREMIUM WITH VOLATILITY</h3>
<p>Vega measures the movement in Options Premium with every 1% move in Implied Volatility (IV).</p>
<p>When Vega drops, it makes both calls and puts lose value.</p>
<p>When Vega rises, it makes both calls and puts gain value.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a tough call to trade on Vega, but for professional Options Traders it makes sense to know how changes in Implied Volatility can impact their positions. Professional traders focus on Delta, Gamma and Theta.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/options/how-to-discover-volatile-and-not-volatile-stocks-for-applying-options-strategies/">You can always use this guide to figure out volatility per stock</a></strong>.</p>
<h3>4. <u>RHO</u>&#8211; CORRELATES OPTIONS PREMIUM WITH 1% CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES</h3>
<p>All options calculators factor in a safe rate of interest, which is the interest rate generally paid on Government Treasury Bonds. Currently the safe rate is hovering between 7.7% and 7.9%.</p>
<p>Though rates are generally stable and moving 1% either way is a Herculean task, even a small change can impact premiums. We&#8217;re at 5 June 2018 and tomorrow is the day of the RBI policy. There&#8217;s a hike in interest rates expected and that could impact options premiums.</p>
<p>Generally, when interest rates are stable, Rho does not impact premiums.</p>
<p><strong>How and When Rho Impacts Options Premiums</strong></p>
<p>When interest rates rise, Call options premium increase and Put Options premium decrease. So, Calls have Positive Rho and Puts Rho is negative.</p>
<p class="bodytextblack">Now. having understood the Greeks, please use this calculator and enter into paper trades and I&#8217; sure you will discover a strategy that fits your trading style.</p>

<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Do you know what an Out-Of-The-Money Option is?</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/options/the-basics-of-options-trading/"><strong>If you are unfamiliar with options terms, read this article first</strong></a>.</p>
<p>If you buy out-of-the-money options at unreasonable premiums or at far away strike prices, an Options Writer will consider you to be an extremely rash trader. This is being politely.</p>
<p>To be blunt, he regards you as an idiot trader but nevertheless loves you, because&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>AN OPTIONS WRITER MAKES HIS MONEY BY EATING PREMIUMS FROM THE OPTIONS HE WRITES (SELLS).</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE OPTIONS WRITER ALSO KNOWS THAT <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AT LEAST 50%</span> OF OPTIONS EXPIRE WITHOUT BEING EXERCISED</strong>. So, if he plays it right, his chances of making profits are up at least 50% even before he starts writing.</p>
<p>The Options Writer is an extremely sharp trader who works with tools that constantly update him on the profit or loss potential of the option he has sold.</p>
<p>We will get to these tools at the end of the article. Let&#8217;s start:</p>
<h2>SECRETS OF OPTIONS WRITERS</h2>
<p><strong>1:</strong> Options writers know that shorting options is a dangerous game and therefore <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they largely square up their position by the end of the day</strong> </span>unless the profit margin is massive (in which case they set a higher Stop Loss in the next trading session).</p>
<p><strong>2:</strong> Options writers <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>always judge the trend</strong></span>. If the trend is bearish, they <strong>Write Call Options.</strong></p>
<p>If the trend is bullish, they <strong>Write Put Options.</strong></p>
<p>As an example, the trend these days (1-6-18) is that Nifty stocks are rising while the midcaps are falling. So the Options Writers will be active writing calls of FNO stocks that do not feature in the Nifty.</p>
<p>Similarly, when a particular sector becomes a hot topic of discussion, like in the case of consumer durable stocks a couple of weeks back, the Options Writers will write Put options of such stocks and indices.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important to judge the market trend if you are a Options Writer.</p>
<p><strong>3:</strong> These writers <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>love stocks that are not volatile</strong></span>.</p>
<p>The idea is to eat premiums on OTM calls and non volatile stocks do not fluctuate much and therefore writers are not too worried about writing both calls and puts.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take the example of Infosys which is around 1100. If the annual volatility of the stock is around 10%, it means that the stock will fluctuate in a band of 990-1210 in a year. This implies a fluctuation of Rs 110 either way in a year, which works out to about Rs 9 per month.</p>
<p>So, in such a case the writers are emboldened to write both puts and calls of 1080 (and below) and 1120 (and above) for a given day and walk away with the premiums. Of course if there&#8217;s a massive fluctuation in Infosys, they will lose. But by and large this strategy works out in 8/10 stocks.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They also love to sell strangles in non-volatile stocks</strong></span>. A strangle is a strategy in which a trader buys an OTM PE and CE of a volatile stock because he expects the combined premium to move up. In non-volatile stock, the reverse happens (premium moves down)..</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/options/how-to-discover-volatile-and-not-volatile-stocks-for-applying-options-strategies/"><strong>Now the question is how to discover volatility per stock and for that you must refer this article</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>4:</strong> Options writers <strong>do NOT focus on just one or two stocks</strong>.</p>
<p>Writing calls and puts for many stocks (some non-volatile, some at overpriced premiums, some at far away strike prices) hedges their risk.</p>
<p>Therefore, the goal is to diversify and not get hooked on to a couple of stocks. Also, writers are cold, calculative and unemotional people.</p>
<p><strong>5:</strong> Options writers write at strike prices that are  about <strong>15% Out of the Money</strong></p>
<p>Typically, the option writer correlates volatility to the time value of the option. The assumption is that by now you know how to measure volatility (see link above).</p>
<p>If you are yet unfamiliar with the terms, start again and read the Options Basics article that I have linked to.</p>
<p>The Options Writer selects options that are significantly out of the money because he knows that the stock will move up hugely only if there&#8217;s a massive move.</p>
<p>OTM Options whose strike prices are +/-15% will likely not be exercised and therefore there are high chances of such options making money for the Writer.</p>
<p><strong>6:</strong> Options writers also love to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>write options when the premium is overpriced</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Now remember this &#8211; the Options Writer is mostly looking to square up his position by the end of the day, so he doesn&#8217;t care what happens tomorrow.</p>
<p>Therefore, he will calculate the fair value of the stock or index (underlying) and if he finds that the premiums are overpriced, he will write the option even though its strike price is closer to the CMP.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They typically write options that are more than 20% overpriced</strong></span>.</p>
<p>These writers have <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>sophisticated surveillance tools</strong></span> that alert them about overpriced premiums, about their live profit and loss position, and cases where premiums begin to spike.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t and therefore you can use online tools to determine if the premium is fair or not. <a href="https://bullbull.in/option-premium-value/"><strong>One such tool is located here</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> Finally, you need to understand <strong>Options Greeks, which are made up of delta, gamma, vega, theta and rho.</strong></p>
<p>Option writers use their values to figure out trades.</p>
<p>This is a rather long topic and I&#8217;ll write a post about it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can start doing paper trades from the knowledge you gathered if you want to become an Options Writer. It will take you at least a month and several paper trades to get the hang of the trade.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you are a plain vanilla investor or an options buyer, then use the information above to understand what to do and what not to do.</p>

<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/market-iq/how-to-analyze-open-interest-data-and-generate-profitable-swing-trades/"><strong>To understand the basic concept of Open Interest (OI), please read through this article</strong></a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now assuming that you now know how OI is calculated and that you know the implications.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 1: <a href="https://www.nseindia.com/live_market/dynaContent/live_watch/option_chain/optionKeys.jsp">Let&#8217;s open the Nifty Options Chain Page for 28 June 2017</a>:</strong></p>
<p>Date: <strong>1 June 2018</strong> &#8211; Time <strong>1.27 PM</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nifty-OPTION-CHAIN.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2554" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nifty-OPTION-CHAIN.jpg" alt="How to analyze options chain" width="1258" height="735" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nifty-OPTION-CHAIN.jpg 1258w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nifty-OPTION-CHAIN-300x175.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nifty-OPTION-CHAIN-768x449.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nifty-OPTION-CHAIN-1024x598.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1258px) 100vw, 1258px" /></a></p>
<p>Note the shaded portion (in light pink tones, both on the left and on the right).</p>
<p><strong>It represents In The Money Strike Prices</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is what In The Money and Out of The Money Strike Prices imply:</p>
<p><strong>A. In the Money (ITM)</strong></p>
<p><strong>– (For Call options) </strong>When strike price is below the stock price. Example, if you buy Nifty 10200CE and the spot price is 10700.</p>
<p><strong>– (For Put options) </strong>When strike price is above the stock price. Example, if you buy Nifty 10800PE and the spot price is 10700.</p>
<p><strong>At the Money (ATM) – </strong>When strike price is equal to the stock price. Example, if you buy Nifty 10700CE or PE and the spot price is 10700.</p>
<p><strong>B. Out of the Money (OTM)</strong></p>
<p><strong>– (For Call options) </strong>When strike price is above the stock price. Example, if you buy Nifty 10800CE and the spot price is 10700.</p>
<p><strong>– (For Put options) </strong>When strike price is below the stock price. Example, if you buy Nifty 10500PE and the spot price is 10700.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Understand the concepts of Call and Put Writing</strong></p>
<p>A writer of a call or a put is a seller.</p>
<p>He sells both calls and puts because he feels the strike prices won&#8217;t hit and he will earn the premium. He also assumes that any buyer of an OTM call or Put is a rash trader.</p>
<p>This is why call and put writers are very active in Out-of-the-Money strike prices, and this is where we must get our clues from.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Copy the Data and paste on an Excel Sheet</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve copied all data and pasted it on an Excel sheet focusing on strike prices between 10050 and 11200.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-OI.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2556" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-OI.jpg" alt="how to read option chain" width="966" height="452" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-OI.jpg 966w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-OI-300x140.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-OI-768x359.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Interpret The OTM Call Writing </strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve highlighted the rows which saw the maximum addition.</p>
<ol>
<li>10,800 CE added 118,527 volume to OI making the OI balloon to 2,182,500 &#8211; this means call writers are reasonably confident that Nifty will have a very tough time crossing 10,800.</li>
<li>10,900 CE added 745,800 volume, ballooning the OI to 2,207, 850 &#8211; this means call writers are reasonably confident that Nifty will also have a very tough time crossing 10,900.</li>
<li>The call writers also felt that crossing 11,000 CE  is another tough call judging from the fact that 92,110 volume was added to OI taking it to 3,782,625. The change in OI was highest at 11,000 indicating that writers were supremely confident that it was almost impossible for the Nifty to cross 11,000.</li>
</ol>
<p>As of today, the call writers feel that Nifty will face it extremely tough to cross 10,800 and beyond, and therefore are happily selling (writing) calls.</p>
<p>It may be that this position gets reversed tomorrow (for example, oil can drop $5, or government can announce a PSU divestment program, etc.). If the position gets reversed, these call writers will get trapped and will have to cover their shorts.</p>
<p>If it comes to covering their shorts, Nifty has the capability of shooting beyond 11,200 purely based on short covering.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Interpret The OTM Put Writing </strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve highlighted the rows which saw the maximum addition.</p>
<ol>
<li>10,600 PE added 97,667 volume taking OI to 3,473,925. This is the highest OI on the Put side and it implies that Put writers are more or less confident that Nifty will not crack 10,600. Note that there was a spurt in OI added, which implies that sellers are very confident not breaking 10,600.</li>
<li>10,700 PE added 90,592 volume taking OI to 2,153,625. It implies that Put writers are more or less confident that Nifty will not crack 10,650. The addition to OI at this Put Strike price was 894,900, which shows the confidence of the Put writers.</li>
</ol>
<p>As of today, put writers feel that Nifty will face it extremely tough to break 10,600 and below, and therefore are happily selling (writing) puts between 10600-10700.</p>
<p>It may be that this position gets reversed tomorrow (for example, Shiv Sena and JDU can ditch the BJP, or oil can rise $5/barrel, etc.). If the position gets reversed, these put writers will get trapped and will have to cover their shorts.</p>
<p>If it comes to covering their shorts, Nifty has the capability of falling below 10,600 and possibly up to 10,200 which represents the next confidence level of the put writers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Checking the position on the Charts</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/a-live-trade-setup-that-can-generate-super-profits/">Please read this article before reading the analysis</a>.</p>
<p><strong>a. The 1 Week Charts of the Nifty at 2.58 PM</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-Chain-on-char.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2560" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-Chain-on-char.jpg" alt="how to chart check options OI" width="1347" height="570" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-Chain-on-char.jpg 1347w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-Chain-on-char-300x127.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-Chain-on-char-768x325.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-Chain-on-char-1024x433.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1347px) 100vw, 1347px" /></a></p>
<p>Though Supertrend suggests a weak trend, you can see that the Nifty is very close to breaking the Supertrend barrier.</p>
<p>The Nifty also hasn&#8217;t broken the Ichimoku Base and Conversion Lines.</p>
<p>The 20Day EMA is still higher than the 50-day EMA.</p>
<p>The MACD Line has crossed above the Signal Line and that is another bullish signal.</p>
<p>Therefore I would say the weekly chart is bullish.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2564" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o.jpg" alt="nifty hourly charts for options" width="1347" height="570" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o.jpg 1347w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o-300x127.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o-768x325.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o-1024x433.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1347px) 100vw, 1347px" /></a>b. The 1 Day Charts of the Nifty at 2.58 PM</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-Chain-on-charts.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2563" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-Chain-on-charts.jpg" alt="how to extrapolate options OI on charts" width="1347" height="570" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-Chain-on-charts.jpg 1347w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-Chain-on-charts-300x127.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-Chain-on-charts-768x325.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-Chain-on-charts-1024x433.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1347px) 100vw, 1347px" /></a></p>
<p>Super trend is bearish but the Nifty can easily breakout on a gap up opening, or a reasonable rise during a trading day.</p>
<p>The Nifty is still above the Ichimoku Base and Conversion Lines.</p>
<p>The MACD suggests a bullish signal.</p>
<p>The 20D EMA is above the 50D EMA.</p>
<p>It is easy to tell Nifty is an uptrend.</p>
<p><strong>c. The 1 Hour Charts of the Nifty at 2.58 PM</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2564" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o.jpg" alt="nifty hourly charts for options" width="1347" height="570" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o.jpg 1347w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o-300x127.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o-768x325.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o-1024x433.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1347px) 100vw, 1347px" /></a></p>
<p>3 indicators (Supertrend, Ichimoku and EMAs) suggest an uptrend while the MACD seems weak, but has not turned bearish.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Reconciling Options OI with Charts</strong></p>
<p>The Options OI for the 28 June 2018 expiry suggests that call and put writers estimate that the Nifty would move in a range f 10600 to 10900.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s do one thing &#8211; let&#8217;s measure the total call and put writers in a (+) (-) 200 to 300 points range.</p>
<p>The Nifty is currently at 10696 (3.30 PM).</p>
<p>The total number of Put Writers between 10450-10700 are 8,948,550.</p>
<p>The total number of Call Writers between 10800-11000 are 8,392,050.</p>
<p>Put Writers exceed Call Writers and therefore the writers are more confident in selling OTM PEs.</p>
<p>So, the analysis is that the writers expect the market to be in the 10600-10900 range and the charts suggest that the markets are more bullish than bearish.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Deciding what to do</strong></p>
<p>After analysis, I would buy an In-The-Money or At-The-Money CE for June Expiry and hold with a SL for 2-3 days.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Anticipating The Change In Trend</strong></p>
<p>This article was written on 1 June 2018 and the expiry is on 28 June. It is possible that the trend changes quickly and therefore you should assume this trend is valid for 2-3 days.</p>
<h2><strong>You can try this strategy on any FNO stock. The chances of success will be greater than that of failure, but you should always work with stop losses.</strong></h2>

<p>It didn&#8217;t work for him, and he asked this question:</p>

<p>So, well, this post will help you discover volatile AND steady stocks on which you can apply Options Strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Before we move ahead, you should read up on the following Options strategies:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/options/long-strangle-options-strategy-for-volatile-stocks/"><strong>LONG STRANGLE</strong></a> (works only on volatile stocks)</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/options/protective-collar-strategy/"><strong>PROTECTIVE COLLAR STRATEGY</strong></a> (works only on stocks that are expected to be steady in the short term and bullish in the long term)</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/options/short-strangle-options-strategy-for-steady-stocks/">SHORT STRANGLE</a></strong> (works only on stocks that are expected to be steady in the near term. Note that this is a slightly risky strategy as it involves shorting.</p>
<h3><strong>HOW TO DISCOVER VOLATILE AND STEADY STOCKS</strong></h3>
<p><strong>METHOD 1: NSE WEBSITE</strong></p>
<p>A. Open</p>
<p>Open <strong><a href="https://www.nseindia.com/products/content/all_daily_reports.htm">NSE Daily Reports</a></strong> and select “<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Derivatives</strong></span>” Tab</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Voolatile1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2481" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Voolatile1.jpg" alt="how to find volatile stocks" width="967" height="488" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Voolatile1.jpg 967w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Voolatile1-300x151.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Voolatile1-768x388.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 967px) 100vw, 967px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Choose “Historical Volatility” in the Derivatives section</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Volatile2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2482" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Volatile2.jpg" alt="how to read NSE derivatives data" width="769" height="413" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Volatile2.jpg 769w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Volatile2-300x161.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Volatile2-768x412.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" /></a></p>
<p>When that page opens, choose &#8220;<strong>Daily Volatility Files,</strong>&#8221; select the previous trading date and download the file.</p>
<p>It will be a CSV file. Open it in Excel, select all rows and columns, and now sort <strong>Column G</strong> from &#8220;<strong>largest to smallest</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/volatile-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2483" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/volatile-3.jpg" alt="NSE volatile stocks data download" width="1350" height="344" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/volatile-3.jpg 1350w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/volatile-3-300x76.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/volatile-3-768x196.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/volatile-3-1024x261.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1350px) 100vw, 1350px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>In our example, PC Jewellers, RCom, R Naval, Star and JP Associates are the most volatile. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The least </strong>volatile stocks will feature at the bottom of the stock. Remember not to consider Indices and stocks that feature in volatile sectors (For example, HDFC Bank volatility was among the lowest, but it sees days of massive volatility because it is used to manage the index.). Choose stocks like PowerGrid, NTPC, etc., which are relatively steady.)</p>
<p><strong>METHOD 2: STOCKS IN THE NEWS</strong></p>
<p>Once a FNO stock gets in the news, for the right or wrong reasons, you see massive volatility. Latch on to it on the first day the news breaks. Examples: Fortis, PC Jewellers, HCC, RNaval, Wockhardt.</p>
<p><strong>METHOD 3: RESULTS DATE</strong></p>
<p>FNO stocks react sharply on results day. Though the results season is over now, there will be many more to come.</p>
<p>This is how you discover volatile and steady stocks to apply options strategies to.</p>
<p>Do not start option trading unless you perfect the techniques using paper trades.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It works great in BULL markets.</strong></span></p>
<h3><strong>How To Play The Synthetic Long Stock Strategy</strong></h3>
<p>The strategy involves</p>
<p>(a) SELLING an AT-THE-MONEY <strong>Put</strong> option</p>
<p>(b) BUYING an AT-THE-MONEY <strong>Call</strong> option</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">with the same expiration date.</span></p>
<p>Note that as the Call and Put options are to be traded at AT-THE-MONEY  prices, it implies that the strike prices are equal to or very close to the CMP.</p>
<p><strong>You should adopt this strategy for stocks the market is BULLISH on. The idea is to gain from both the call that you have bought and the put that you have shorted.</strong></p>
<p>THIS IS (PREFERABLY) AN INTRA DAY STRATEGY UNLESS YOU ARE SURE OF CONTINUED BULLISHNESS. NOTE THAT CARRYING FORWARD SHORTS IS EXTREMELY HARMFUL FOR YOUR FINANCIAL HEATH.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with an example.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>23 May 2018</strong></span>, (10.15 PM) and a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>bullish stock</strong> </span>we have identified is <strong>TATA MOTORS  (it&#8217;s fallen drastically and there may be short covering)</strong>.</p>
<p>Its CMP is 313.</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 310 PE is 9.00</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 310 CE is 12.00</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s do the trade.</p>
<p>1,500 units in one lot, so the total investment works out to:</p>
<p>1,500 X 9 = 13,500 (at 100% margin, have excluded MTM losses, volatility and risk margins) (for the PE)</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>1,500 X 12 = 18,000 (for the CE)</p>
<p>Total = RS 31,500</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It&#8217;s 11.35 PM now and the rates are</strong></span>:</p>
<p>The CMP is 314.35</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 310 PE is 7.90</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 310 CE is 13.10</p>
<p>We are gaining, so let&#8217;s book profits:</p>
<p>PE &#8211; 1,500 shares X 1.10 (9-7.90) = 1,650 per lot</p>
<p>(PLUS)</p>
<p>CE &#8211; 1,500 shares X 1.10 (13.10-12) = 1,650 per lot</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Net Profit = RS 3,300 </strong></span></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s book out now because the gains are reasonable. Know that you can make much more if the stock rises per your expectations.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m posting this article at 11.45 AM. You may check the price and option premium movements throughout the day.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>FOLLOW ON AT 3.30 PM and the rates are</strong></span>:</p>
<p>The CMP is 310</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 310 PE is 10.80</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 310 CE is 11.00</p>
<p>We are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LOSING</strong></span>:</p>
<p>PE &#8211; 1,500 shares X 1.80 (9-10.80) = 2,700 per lot</p>
<p>(PLUS)</p>
<p>CE &#8211; 1,500 shares X 1.00 (11-12) = 1,500 per lot</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Net LOSS= RS 4.200 </strong></span></p>
<p><strong>THEREFORE YOU SHOULD USE THIS STRATEGY INTRA DAY AND EXIT ONCE YOU SEE GREEN OR HIT BUDGETED LOSSES. DO NOT WAIT IT OUT.</strong></p>
<p><strong>BUDGETING FOR LOSSES</strong></p>
<p>Remember that trades can go wrong and therefore you always must work with a budgeted loss while playing options. If you are willing to lose no more than Rs 4,000 per trade, book out when your losses hit your targets.</p>
<h3>When to Enter Into A Synthetic Long</h3>
<ol>
<li>In extremely bullish stocks.</li>
<li>In a bull run</li>
<li>In stocks that are bullish in the near term (for example, Tata Motors was selected because a bounce back was expected).</li>
<li>When the general market is rising and advances outnumber declines by a wide margin.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Caution</strong></h3>
<p>Square up both options at the same time, preferably intra day. Book out as soon as you make some money or hit your budgeted loss number.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It works great in bear markets.</strong></span></p>
<h3><strong>How To Play The Synthetic Short Strategy</strong></h3>
<p>The strategy involves</p>
<p>(a) SELLING an AT-THE-MONEY <strong>Call</strong> option</p>
<p>(b) BUYING an AT-THE-MONEY <strong>Put</strong> option</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">with the same expiration date.</span></p>
<p>Note that as the Call and Put options are to be traded at AT-THE-MONEY  prices, it implies that the strike prices are equal to or very close to the CMP.</p>
<p><strong>You should adopt this strategy for stocks you are bearish on. The idea is to gain from both the put that you have bought and the call that you have shorted.</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with an example.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>21 May 2018</strong></span>, (12.30 PM) and a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>bearish stock</strong> </span>we have identified is <strong>JUST DIAL</strong>.</p>
<p>Just Dial was selected because</p>
<p>(a) Results expected today and it is more a weak number</p>
<p>(b) Just Dial is a Google  competitor and it does not stand a chance unless it rejigs its business model.</p>
<p>Its CMP is 422.</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 420 PE is 22</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 420 CE is 22</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s do the trade.</p>
<p>1,400 units in one lot, so the total investment works out to:</p>
<p>1,400 X 22 = 30,800 (at 100% margin, have excluded MTM losses, volatility and risk margins) (for the CE)</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>1,400 X 22 = 30,800 (at 100% margin) (for the PE)</p>
<p>Total = RS 61,600</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It&#8217;s 1.25 PM now and the rates are</strong></span>:</p>
<p>The CMP is 417</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 420 PE is 23.50</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 420 CE is 21</p>
<p>We are gaining, so let&#8217;s book profits:</p>
<p>PE &#8211; 1,400 shares X 1.50 (23.50-22) = 2,100 per lot</p>
<p>(PLUS)</p>
<p>CE &#8211; 1,400 shares X 1 (22 &#8211; 21) = 1,400 per lot</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Net Profit = RS 3,500 </strong></span></p>
<p>We won&#8217;t wait for the results and book out now because the gains are fairly good. Know that you can make much more if the stock falls per your expectations.</p>
<p>Also, Just Dial is a volatile stock for which the Long Strangle should work better. Anyway, this too worked out.</p>
<p>UPDATE: At 3.30 PM, the situation was:</p>
<p>The CMP is 4o7</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 420 PE is 26</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 420 CE is 17</p>
<p>Had we squared up at 3.30 PM, our profits would have been:</p>
<p>PE &#8211; 1,400 shares X 4 (26-22) = 5,600 per lot</p>
<p>(PLUS)</p>
<p>CE &#8211; 1,400 shares X 5 (22 &#8211; 17) = 5,600 per lot</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Net Profit = RS 11,200 </strong></span></p>
<h3>BUDGETING FOR LOSSES</h3>
<p>Remember that trades can go wrong and therefore you always must work with a budgeted loss while playing options. If you are willing to lose no more than Rs 3,000 per trade, book out when your losses hit your targets.</p>
<h3>When to Enter Into A Synthetic Short</h3>
<ol>
<li>In extremely bearish stocks.</li>
<li>In stocks that are bearish in the near term but can be bullish or neutral in the long run.</li>
<li>When the general market is falling and declines outnumber advances by a wide margin.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Caution</strong></h3>
<p>Square up both options at the same time, preferably on the same day. Book out as soon as you make some money or hit your budgeted loss number.</p>

<p>As this strategy requires shorting, it MUST be squared up intraday (preferably) unless you are reasonably certain of the price movement.</p>
<h3><strong>How To Play The Short Strangle Strategy</strong></h3>
<p>The strategy involves SELLING</p>
<p>(a) an out-of-the money call option at a strike price that is HIGHER than the PE you are about to short</p>
<p>(b) an out-of-the-money put option at a strike price that is LOWER than the shorted CE</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">with the same expiration date.</span></p>
<p>The idea is to eat both the premiums, or a good part of them, if the stock remains steady.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with an example.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>11 May 2018</strong></span>, (10 AM) and a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>steady stock</strong> </span>we have identified is <strong>PowerGrid</strong>.</p>
<p>The CMP is 208.</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 205 PE is 2.50</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 215 CE is 1.90</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s SELL one lot each.</p>
<p>4000 units in one lot, so the total margin investment works out to:</p>
<p>4000 X 2.50 = 10,000</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>4000 X 1.90 = 7,600</p>
<p>Total = RS 17,600</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It&#8217;s 12.30 PM now and the rates are</strong></span>:</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 205 PE is available at 2</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 215 CE is available at 2</p>
<p>If we book out now, our profits are:</p>
<p>PE &#8211; 4000 X 0.50 = 2,000</p>
<p>(LESS)</p>
<p>CE &#8212; 4000 X 0.10 = 400</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Net Profit = RS 1,600</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It&#8217;s 3.20 PM now and the rates are</strong></span>:</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 205 PE is available at 2.80</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 215 CE is available at 1.45</p>
<p>If we book out now, our profits are:</p>
<p>PE (LOSS) &#8211; 4000 X 0.30 = <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>1,200</strong></span></p>
<p>(LESS)</p>
<p>CE &#8212; 4000 X 0.35 = <strong><span style="color: #008000;">1,400</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Net Profit = RS 200</strong></span></p>
<p>Though the profits are small, you didn&#8217;t lose anything. And if the markets remain listless, you will end up making much more. This is a low risk low profits strategy so long you square up positions on the same day.</p>
<h3>BUDGETING FOR LOSSES</h3>
<p>Remember this &#8211; when you are shorting calls and puts, always work make a budget for losses. For example, if you are willing to lose no more than Rs 2,000 per trade, book out when your losses hit your budgets.</p>
<h3>When to Enter Into A Short Strangle</h3>
<ol>
<li>In extremely steady stocks.</li>
<li>In stocks that are bullish on long term but with a neutral near-term outlook.</li>
<li>In any stock that are NOT in the news.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Caution</strong></h3>
<p>Square up both options at the same time, preferably on the same day.</p>

<p>Think about what&#8217;s happening to PC Jewellers now and what happened to Fortis a while back when it crashed from 200+ to 110. These are the stocks for which the Long Strangle can work wonders.</p>
<p>You also can maximize gains if you can intelligently anticipate which way the stock will move. However, even if you cannot anticipate the movement, then this strategy will yield limited profits or losses (mostly profits).</p>
<h3><strong>How To Play The Long Strangle Strategy</strong></h3>
<p>The strategy involves buying</p>
<p>(a) an out-of-the money call option</p>
<p>(b) an out-of-the-money put option</p>
<p>with the same expiration date.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with an example. Let&#8217;s identify the stock.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s 7 May 2018, and volatile stock that hits us smack in the face is <strong>PC Jewellers</strong>.</p>
<p>The CMP is 225.</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 200 PE is 12</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 250 CE is 16</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s buy one lot each.</p>
<p>1500 units in one lot, so the total investment works out to:</p>
<p>1500 X 12 = 18,000</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>1500 X 16 = 24,000</p>
<p>Total = RS 42,000</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The rates mentioned above were prevalent at around 11 AM.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It&#8217;s 11.35 AM now and the rates are</strong></span>:</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 200 PE is 10</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 250 CE is 20</p>
<p>If we book out now, our profits are:</p>
<p>1500 X 10 = 15,000</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>1500 X 20 = 30,000</p>
<p>Total = RS 45,000</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>There&#8217;s a straight profit of Rs 3,000 within 40 minutes</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s wait and watch some more.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It&#8217;s 2.10 PM now and the rates are</strong></span>:</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 200 PE is 9</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 250 CE is 23</p>
<p>If we book out now, our profits are:</p>
<p>1500 X 9 = 13,500</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>1500 X 23 = 34,500</p>
<p>Total = RS 48,000</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>There&#8217;s a straight profit of Rs 6,000 in 95 minutes</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s wait and watch some more, and set the cut off time to 3.00 PM to finish up the article.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It&#8217;s 3.00 PM now and the rates are</strong></span>:</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 200 PE is 8.50</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 250 CE is 22.50</p>
<p>If we book out now, our profits are:</p>
<p>1500 X 8.50 = 12,750</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>1500 X 22.50 = 33,750</p>
<p>Total = RS 46,000</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>There&#8217;s a straight profit of Rs 4,000</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s square up this mock trade and be happy with Rs 4,000 in the pocket.</p>
<p>UPDATE ON 8-5-18</p>
<p>If the position was carried over for a day, here is how the profits would have looked:</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 200 PE is 28</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 250 CE is 23</p>
<p>If we book out now, our profits are:</p>
<p>1500 X 28 = 42,000</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>1500 X 23 = 34,500</p>
<p>Total = RS 76,500</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>There&#8217;s a straight profit of Rs 34,500</strong></span>.</p>
<h3>Worst Case Scenario</h3>
<p>The worst case scenario in this case would have been P C Jewellers staying steady or moving 5 bucks either way during the day.</p>
<p>If it were steady, you would have lost the options brokerage, which would have been a 100 bucks here or there.</p>
<p>In the worst possible case (inconsistently steady movement) you would have max lost a buck either way and your losses would have been capped to Rs 3,000 (worst case).</p>
<h3>Anticipation</h3>
<p>In the book trade, I picked up out-of-money CE and PE that were 25 bucks away from the CMP.</p>
<p>Had I anticipated that the chance of PC Jewellers moving higher than greater than it moving lower, I would have picked up a cheaper PE (say at around 180 strike price) and maximized my gains.</p>
<h3>When to Enter Into A Long Strangle</h3>
<ol>
<li>In volatile stocks, at any time.</li>
<li>On or around results&#8217; day.</li>
<li>By monitoring company announcements and entering into a long strangle on the day of the meeting.</li>
<li>In any stock that is heavily in the news, for whatever reason, good or bad.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Caution</strong></h3>
<p>Square up both options at the same time, preferably in 1-2 days from the day of entering into the trade or when you feel that the volatility has fizzled out.</p>
<p><strong>Do not leave any call open.</strong></p>
<p>Remember that as time passes and the expiration comes closer, the time value of options erode rapidly. Therefore you must book your profits or losses quickly for this strategy. Don&#8217;t allow your option to rot</p>
<p>If you are new to options, create an Excel sheet and enter into mock trades. Play the real market only when you have sort of mastered options.</p>

<p>A Protective Caller strategy is suited for <strong>FNO stock investors</strong> and <strong>Option Writers</strong> who are bullish on a stock but would like to eat premiums too. It involves:</p>
<p>a. Buying x number of any FNO stocks that the investor or options writer is bullish on</p>
<p>b. Shorting a Out-of-the-Money <strong>call</strong></p>
<p>c. Going Long on a Out-of-the-Money <strong>put</strong></p>
<p>YOU SHOULD PLAY THIS ONLY WHEN THE LONG TERM TREND OF THE STOCK IS <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BULLISH </strong></span>AND/OR THE SHORT TERM TREND OF THE STOCK IS <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>STEADY.</strong></span></p>
<h3>How To Play The Protective Collar (Example)</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s 4 May 2018, and let&#8217;s assume you are bullish on Grasim. The CMP is 1080. In your estimate, Grasim can hit 1,300 in 4 months, but will languish around 1050-1140 in the near term and before the nearest expiry.</p>
<p>One Option lot is 750 shares.</p>
<p>You transact the following:</p>
<p>Buy 500 shares of Grasim at 1080</p>
<p>Sell 1 Lot (750 shares) of Grasim 1200 CE 31-5-18 Expiry at Rs 4</p>
<p>Buy 1 Lot (750 shares) of Grasim 1000 PE 31-5-18 Expiry at Rs 6</p>
<p><strong>SCENARIO 1: Stock remains Steady</strong></p>
<p>If Grasim is steady at 1080 before or around the expiry date, then your CE will not be exercised and you will make Rs 3,000 (750 shares X Rs 4). Your PE will remain steady and when you sell it, you may incur a maximum loss of Re 1-2. Let&#8217;s assume you lose Rs 2 per share on the PE, and your loss on the PE is Rs 1,500.</p>
<p>In scenario 1, you continue holding on to the stock which you are bullish on, and end up pocketing Rs 1,500 by playing the protective collar.</p>
<p><strong>SCENARIO 2: Stock Falls</strong></p>
<p>If Grasim falls to 1020 before or around the expiry date, your CE will not get exercised and you will make Rs 3,000 (750 shares X Rs 4). Your PE will appreciate to about Rs 18.</p>
<p><strong>How did I calculate it to be Rs 18? </strong></p>
<p>Well I used the <a href="https://bullbull.in/option-premium-value/">Option Premium Calculator</a> here and assumed:</p>
<p>15 days to expiry<br />
7% safe rate of interest (on Bank FDs/Govt Bonds)<br />
30% annual volatility in the price of Grasim (you can play around with the percentage)<br />
1% dividend yield (it is actually lesser)</p>
<p>Now, the options premium calculator threw up a figure of Rs 15 for the put option. However, CEs and PEs in our markets are generally overpriced, so I assumed Rs 18.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Option-premium-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2198" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Option-premium-1.jpg" alt="protective collar option" width="701" height="577" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Option-premium-1.jpg 701w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Option-premium-1-300x247.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px" /></a></p>
<p>So your Put option would fetch you Rs 18 less Rs 6 (cost) = Rs 12 X 750 shares = 9,000</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Your total gains from the protective collar would be 9,000 + 3,000 = 12,000.</span></strong></p>
<p>However the notional loss of the stock price would set you back psychologically. Nevertheless, remember that you have purchased the stock for the long term and therefore the fall should not bother you.</p>
<p>You also can keep playing with the Protective Collar strategy in the next expiry and keep reducing your acquisition cost. Actually, you should keep playing this strategy until the trend for Grasim turns upwards for the short term.</p>
<p><strong>SCENARIO 3: Stock Rises</strong></p>
<p>If Grasim jumps to 1150 before or around the expiry date, your CE will appreciate to about Rs 15.</p>
<p><strong>How did I calculate it to be Rs 15? </strong></p>
<p>Well I used the <a href="https://bullbull.in/option-premium-value/">Option Premium Calculator</a> here and assumed:</p>
<p>15 days to expiry<br />
7% safe rate of interest (on Bank FDs/Govt Bonds)<br />
30% annual volatility in the price of Grasim (you can play around with the percentage)<br />
1% dividend yield (it is actually lesser)</p>
<p>Now, the options premium calculator threw up a figure of Rs 11 for the Call option. However, CEs and PEs in our markets are generally overpriced, so I assumed Rs 15.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Option-premium-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2199" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Option-premium-2.jpg" alt="options premium calculator" width="701" height="577" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Option-premium-2.jpg 701w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Option-premium-2-300x247.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you will lose Rs 8,250 (750 shares X Rs 11 (CE covered at 15; sold at 4). Your PE will become worthless and you will incur a loss of 3,000 (your purchase cost).</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">So your Option losses would be 8.250 + 3,000 = 11,250 </span></strong></p>
<p>However, at this point you may choose to book profits. If so, your profit will work out to <strong>Rs 70 (1150 sale price; 1080 purchase cost)) X 500 = Rs 35,000.</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, in this scenario, your net profit will work out to <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Rs 35,000</strong></span> (-) <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Rs 11,250</strong></span> = <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Rs 23,750</strong></span>.</p>
<h3>When To Play The Protective Collar Spread</h3>
<ol>
<li>When you are certain that a stock will rise in the long run but may remain steady  before the nearest expiry date.</li>
<li>When you expect the results to be good.</li>
<li>Wen you expect an exciting announcement at the forthcoming corporate meeting.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Caution</strong></h3>
<p>Square up both options at the same time, preferably 7-10 days before the expiry date. <strong>It is extremely dangerous to leave a short call open.</strong></p>
<p>Remember that as time passes and the expiration comes closer, the time value of options erode rapidly. Therefore you must book your profits or losses ahead of expiry.</p>
<p>If you are new to options, create an Excel sheet and enter into mock trades. Play the real market only when you have sort of mastered options.</p>

<div class="parsys_column cq-colctrl-lt0-c0">
<div class="text parbase section">
<p>A bull put spread is a low risk, low gain spread that entails trading in two puts (PEs) that expire on the same date but at different strike prices.</p>
<p>You have to short one put option and buy another put at a lower strike price. The put you short generates the income and the put you buy minimizes your loss, if any.</p>
<p>YOU SHOULD PLAY THIS ONLY WHEN THE TREND IS <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BULLISH.</strong></span></p>
<h3>How To Play The Bull Put Spread (Example)</h3>
<p>Nifty is at 10650 as on 3 May 2018.</p>
<p>Let us assume you are bullish on the market and feel that Nifty can hit 10800 by end-May. But knowing that markets are uncertain, you would not like to buy a naked (one side) option.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s what you can do:</p>
<p>SELL 10600 PE at 105 (1 lot = 75 units)</p>
<p>BUY 10500 PE at  75 (1 lot = 75 units)</p>
<p>If Nifty hits 10,800 by 31 May 2018, both PEs will not be exercised, and you will gain</p>
<p>Rs 30* X 75 = 2,250</p>
<p>(*You will receive 105 and pay 75).</p>
<p>If Nifty does not move as per your expectations, and it falls, both options will get exercised and in the worst case and your loss will be limited to your hedge (shorted at 105, covered at 75, therefore loss is RS 30):</p>
<p>Rs 30 per unit (the difference ) X 75 = 2,250 maximum.</p>
<p>If the strategy does not work out and the Nifty declines, it is not necessary that you will have to incur the entire loss. In order to limit the loss you must read the fall well and cover the short option and wait for the long put option to appreciate. Know that if your calculation does not work out your loss will increase but will be limited to the cost you incurred (75 per unit) for the put.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either way your gains and losses are capped.</p>
<h3>You should enter into this trade only when the prices are steady or in a bull trend. This strategy is ideal for folks who are averse to risk-taking and are content with small profits (or losses).</h3>
<h3>When To Play The Bull Call Spread</h3>
<ol>
<li>When you are 60%-70% certain that the market will rise before the expiry date.</li>
<li>When you expect good news over the weekend.</li>
<li>During results period, when you are, say, more than 50% sure of a positive outcome.</li>
<li>#3 can be extended to events as well based on forthcoming corporate meetings.</li>

<h3><strong>Caution</strong></h3>
<p>Square up both the calls at the same time. <strong>It is extremely dangerous to leave a short call open in a volatile market.</strong></p>
<p>It is however recommended that you close out both options on the same day preferably around the same time.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>AGAIN: Never leave a short option open &#8211; if markets turn, you will end up paying through your nose.</strong></span></p>
<p>Remember that as time passes and the expiration comes closer, the time value of options erode rapidly. Therefore you must book your profits or losses ahead of expiry.</p>
<p>If you are new to options, create an Excel sheet and enter into mock trades. Play the real market only when you have sort of mastered options.</p>
