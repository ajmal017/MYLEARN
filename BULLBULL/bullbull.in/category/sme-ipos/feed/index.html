Is it worth applying to?</p>
<p>Find out in our unbiased review:</p>
<p><strong>MOAT</strong></p>
<p>Priti International makes small ticket home furnishing items and accessories, some furniture, pet comfort products, bags, and other personal goods. From the website it seems that it wants to expand into other home items, specially in furniture.</p>
<p>It is a decent line of business. Majority of the products are exported and the competition comes from the unorganized export sector and of course, from China.</p>
<p>At first glance, the company does radiate a decent perception, even though the moat is of average strength.</p>
<p><strong>PAST</strong></p>
<p>The company is new in the sense it has purchased the sole proprietorship company of the promoter for a consideration of 1.54 crores. So, there&#8217;s no point in going into the financials.</p>
<p>However&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/priti-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2625" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/priti-1.jpg" alt="priti international cash flows" width="709" height="383" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/priti-1.jpg 709w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/priti-1-300x162.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 100vw, 709px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230;it is important to note that the company reported a negative operational cash flow for the period ended 31-12-17 and ended up financing its operations and investments from debt. This is because the company took over the business of the proprietor on 30 November 2017 for 1.54 crores, and that leaves a question &#8211; if the company was formed for taking over the business of the proprietor, who is now a promoter, why did it incur a cash outflow of Rs 1.96 crores from operations?</p>
<p>Now, it will be interesting to figure out how the company has priced the share at Rs 75.</p>
<p><strong>IPO PRICING</strong></p>
<p>The company justifies a price of Rs 75 a share because of</p>
<p>a. Experienced management</p>
<p>b. Global presence (but the company does not have offices overseas)</p>
<p>c. EPS of 3.47 on pre IPO capital. (this will further dilute post-IPO)</p>
<p>d. Return on Net Worth of 3.99% (Isn&#8217;t this a rather poor RoR?)</p>
<p>e. NAV of Rs 21 on 31-12-17</p>
<p>These are rather weak reasons for justifying an issue price of Rs 75.</p>
<h2>Given these factors, and despite the company exuding a good perception, I would wait and see what happens post listing before deciding to enter or avoid Priti International.</h2>

The issue proceeds will be utilized for loan repayment,buying fleet and working capital requirements.</p>
<p>The company is considering a pre-IPO placement of 968000 shares. If this goes through, the shares issued to the public would be reduced to that extent.</p>
<p>Is the issue worth subscribing to? Find out in our unbiased review:</p>
<p><strong>1.MOAT</strong></p>
<p>Accuracy&#8217;s niche is that it focuses on granite and marble logistics (inland and exports). The company owns 150 vehicles and operates mainly in the Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra. It faces a lot of competition, and in that sense it is has a below-average moat.</p>
<p>However, one thing to note is that the company has been adding fleet every year and that is a good sign.</p>
<p><strong>2. A CURIOUS CASE</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a question:</p>
<p>If you own a company that requires massive working capital, and you have obtained a whole lot of finance in the last 5 years, faced negative cash flow issues in the past. own subsidiaries that are in losses, and work in an intensely competitive field, would you or other promoters float a firm that competes with the main company?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what your answer to the question is, but Accuracy Shipping does all of the above activities that are listed in the question. Here&#8217;s the dope:</p>
<p><strong>Negative Cash Flows</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2603" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-3.jpg" alt="accuracy shipping cash flows" width="684" height="406" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-3.jpg 684w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-3-300x178.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Intensive Working Capital Requirement</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2604" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-4.jpg" alt="accuracy shipping working capital" width="628" height="440" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-4.jpg 628w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-4-300x210.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>In house Competition</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2605" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-2.jpg" alt="accuracy shipping in house competition" width="652" height="404" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-2.jpg 652w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-2-300x186.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>3. Financials</strong></p>
<p>Despite the slowdown in exports, the company has clocked a massive rise in turnover for the 9-month period ending on 31-12-17.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2608" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-5.jpg" alt="accuracy shipping financials" width="638" height="267" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-5.jpg 638w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-5-300x126.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s book value was 21 as on 31-12-17.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that rising oil prices will hit its profitability in the near term until these prices recede.</p>
<p>The long term debt is 27 crore and the short term debt is about 12 crore. That makes it 39 crores. Now, the interest provided is 2.50 crores, which works out to a 6.4% rate of interest. This can be because the loans may have been obtained towards the end of the year. Still it is a factor that you should clarify before applying.</p>
<p>The post issue capital will be about 15 crores and assuming the current profitability is maintained, the EPS for 2018-19 would work out to about Rs 4.55. At Rs 84 issue price, the PE works out to 19, which seems fully priced for a new entrant.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;d wait for the stock to list before considering trading it. Smallcaps too are falling and many are available at very attractive prices. In such a situation it is best to be a fence sitter.</p>

<p>Is it worth applying to?</p>
<p>Find out in our no-holds barred review.</p>
<p><strong>BUSINESS AND MOAT</strong></p>
<p>The company is into the corporate gifting business. It makes clocks in bulk for companies wishing to give these away as mementos for any occasion.</p>
<p>By and large, the company imports clock stuff (fancy designs, etc.), assembles these here and brands them with their client&#8217;s logo. Exports make up about 40% of sales (2017).</p>
<p>The promoter&#8217;s in the clock business since 32 years, and that&#8217;s a positive sign.</p>
<p>The company is well entrenched in the market and so long corporates keep gifting clocks, it will do well.</p>
<p><strong>QUIRKY VEHICLE LOANS</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2520" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam1.jpg" alt="sonam clock ipo car loans" width="747" height="315" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam1.jpg 747w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam1-300x127.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px" /></a></p>
<p>Promoters buy cars in their personal name and company pays the loans. Shouldn&#8217;t the title be in the company&#8217;s name? Though the amount is not significant, the accounting practice is not desirable.</p>
<p><strong>REPAYMENT OF LOAN TO PROMOTER</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2521" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam2.jpg" alt="sonam clock ipo objectives" width="724" height="127" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam2.jpg 724w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam2-300x53.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></a></p>
<p>One of the objectives of the issue is to repay a 2 crore loan to the promoter.</p>
<p>So if I have a 32 years of experience in a company, run a successful business and own an established brand, and have given a 2 crore loan to my company, why would I get it repaid through an IPO? Wouldn&#8217;t I rather be repaid with retained earnings and use the IPO proceeds for expanding business?</p>
<p><strong>NEGATIVE CASH FLOWS</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2522" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam3.jpg" alt="SONAM CLOCK CASH FLOWS" width="740" height="217" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam3.jpg 740w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam3-300x88.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></a></p>
<p>An established brand and business with a promoter with decades of experience is expected to generate positive cash flows at the operational level.</p>
<p><strong>IN HOUSE COMPETITION</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2523" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam4.jpg" alt="sonam clocks competition" width="742" height="252" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam4.jpg 742w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam4-300x102.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px" /></a></p>
<p>The promoters own another company that freely competes with the one issuing the shares. Conflict of interest always weakens any business.</p>
<p><strong>BASIS FOR PRICING</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2524" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam5.jpg" alt="sonam clock basis for pricing" width="739" height="242" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam5.jpg 739w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam5-300x98.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /></a></p>
<p>The weighted average of the EPS BEFORE the IPO is 1.28. This will bet diluted post issue. The company is issuing shares at Rs 36, which results in a PE (pre IPO) of 28. Post IPO the PE will be higher.</p>
<p>The issue is at a high price.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>IMO the issue is priced very high and therefore I would give it a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>MISS</strong></span>.</p>

Of this 17.5 lakh shares make for a fresh offer while 2.5 lakh shares are being offered by existing shareholders.</p>
<p>Is the issue worth applying to? Find out in this unbiased review.</p>
<p><strong>COMPLIANCE ISSUES</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/waa1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2509" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/waa1.jpg" alt="waa solar compliance" width="640" height="356" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/waa1.jpg 640w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/waa1-300x167.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/waa1-260x146.jpg 260w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/waa1-120x67.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>The company has given 23.5 crore loans to group companies and relatives of directors and in addition has given a guarantee of 325 crores on behalf of a loan obtained by another group company Both acts are not in compliance of the Companies Act, and therefore a red flag.</p>
<p>Additionally, the company has pledged its investment of 93,90,600 Shares in a subsidiary company, Madhav Karnataka (Solar) Private limited, with lenders of 63 Crores to that subsidiary company. This is in compliance of all laws, though.</p>
<p><strong>OVERSTATED RESERVES</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/waa2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2510" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/waa2.jpg" alt="waa solar overstated reserves" width="641" height="226" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/waa2.jpg 641w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/waa2-300x106.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" /></a></p>
<p>The company has changed its method of accounting depreciation from Written Down Value to Straight Line method. This has inflated its reserves by about 43.5 crores.</p>
<p>Now, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s really interesting. See this image.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/waa6.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2515" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/waa6.jpg" alt="waa solar reserves and surplus" width="683" height="197" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/waa6.jpg 683w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/waa6-300x87.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></a></p>
<p>The total reserves are 115.20 crores, of which 43.5 crores are because of the change in the depreciation method, and the rest of the reserves is represented by share premium. This implies that retained earnings are negative (115.20 crores less 43.5 crores = 72 crores which is lesser than the share premium of Rs 75.34 crores).</p>
<p><strong>CASH FLOWS</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/waa4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2512" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/waa4.jpg" alt="waa solar cash flows" width="642" height="213" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/waa4.jpg 642w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/waa4-300x100.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" /></a></p>
<p>Though the cash flows are positive there&#8217;s a whole lot of inconsistency. For example, the company has generated operating cash of 22.37 crores for the year ended 31-3-17, but for next 8 months, the operational cash is a negative 92 lakhs. It&#8217;s very inconsistent.</p>
<p><strong>BUSINESS AND OTHER FACTORS</strong></p>
<p>The company seems to have a working business model having won contracts from the Gujarat and Punjab governments. From what I saw on the website, the business looks good.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>Give the ballooning up of reserves because of the change in the accounting method, the non compliance of statutory provisions and the relatively high Debt:Equity ratio (88 crore debt and about 6.7 crore post issue equity capital on consolidated basis), and the fact that other solar companies are not too hot, I would give this issue a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>MISS</strong></span>.</p>

<p>The company is into the production of hybrid seeds. It is a competitive field in which even government agencies compete. So it all boils down t the kind of value the company&#8217;s seeds are generating for the farmer, and this depends on their R &amp; D.</p>
<p>The business is seasonal and the company is required to tank up on stocks, necessitating heavy working capital requirements. Its main markets are MP, Maharashtra and Jharkhand, but it is also expanding to other states.</p>
<p>The moat depends on the company&#8217;s ability to create superior seeds and educate the farmer of their advantages. Also, food as a business has a fantastic future given the rising population.</p>
<p><strong>IMPROVING CASH FLOWS:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shreeoswal.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2489" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shreeoswal.jpg" alt="SHREE OSWAL SEEDS CASH FLOWS" width="630" height="335" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shreeoswal.jpg 630w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shreeoswal-300x160.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></a></p>
<p>The cash flows of the company look impressive. The company financed its operations by debt up to 2015 and since then it has been repaying debt. This looks good.</p>
<p><strong>SUBSIDIARY </strong></p>
<p>Shree Oswal Psyllium processes and sells psyllium husk (Sat Isabgol), and belongs 100% to the parent company.</p>
<p><strong>FINANCIALS</strong></p>
<p>Checked the financials up to 30 November 2017.  The company also had provided BS from 1 April 2017 to 30 January 2018 and P/L for December and January 2018. Comparing 2018 figures would have caused confusion and therefore I stuck to analyzing up to 30 November 2017.</p>
<p>On sales of 35 crores, the company generated a net profit after tax of 88 lakhs. It&#8217;s a lo 2.5% margin, but what is good is that the operational cash flows were positives and the company paid 45 lakhs tax.</p>
<p>But the short term debt is massive. Against a pre-IPO capital of Rs 6.17 crore, the long term debt is 6.34 crores and the short term debt is 19.87 crores. Though the short term debt is adequately covered by the inventories, the interest will hit the company&#8217;s profitability.</p>
<p><strong>ISSUE PRICING</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shreeoswal2-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2491" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shreeoswal2-1.jpg" alt="shree oswal seeds general reserves" width="622" height="257" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shreeoswal2-1.jpg 622w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shreeoswal2-1-300x124.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px" /></a></p>
<p>The first thing that strikes is that the Reserves and Surplus are very low, and the company is issuing shares at RS 26, a premium of Rs 16.</p>
<p>Granted that the promoters have worked very hard to repay their old loans, but for that they have been rewarded by a reduced cost of acquisition of shares at Rs 10 per share.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Rs 15 (Rs 5 premium) would have been an investor-friendly IPO price.</p>
<p><strong>EQUITY SHARE CAPITAL</strong></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s equity capital was 6.16 crores.</p>
<p>On 26 February 2018, about 45 lakh shares were issued at Rs 10.25 in lieu of Rs 4.4 crore loan to the company.</p>
<p>So, prior to the issue, the capital is Rs 10.66 crores.</p>
<p>Add to this another 45.78 lakh shares of the IPO and we get a share capital of Rs 16.44 crores.</p>
<p>The profit for 8 months ended 30 November 2017 was 89 lakhs, so let&#8217;s say the profit for the whole year would work up to Rs 1.4 crores.</p>
<p>That leaves us with an EPS of Re 0.85.</p>
<p>The IPO is priced at a PE of 30.5, which is very aggressive.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>All in all, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>this looks like a decent IPO except for the fact it is priced high</strong></span>. There are insignificant legal issues, the promoters have bought the shares at par, the company is in the ever-growing food business, etc., etc.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I would buy the stock in the open market if it falls to Rs 12-15. </strong></span></p>

<p>Palm Jewels is a jewelry designer and wholesaler &#8211; in the sense that it designs and manufactures chains, bracelets and necklaces in bulk and sells these to other jewelry stores. Jewelry making is outsourced to job workers.</p>
<p>This is a very fragile moat because if jewelry shops decide to set up their design or job outsourcing department, orders will shrink for Palm Jewels.</p>
<p>A very very weak moat.</p>
<p><strong>NEGATIVE CASH FLOWS</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/palm1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2469" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/palm1.jpg" alt="palm jewels ipo cash flows" width="647" height="212" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/palm1.jpg 647w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/palm1-300x98.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px" /></a></p>
<p>Would you buy a stock at Rs 30 when the operational cash flows are either negative or insignificant?</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t you expect a jewelry wholesaler to report positive operational cash flows?</p>
<p><strong>IN HOUSE COMPETITION</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/palm2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2470" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/palm2.jpg" alt="palm jewels competition" width="657" height="338" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/palm2.jpg 657w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/palm2-300x154.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px" /></a></p>
<p>A company tries to create a moat around itself by building an impregnable business model. However, Palm Jewels group companies compete with it.</p>
<p><strong>BUMP UP IN EQUITY AND RESERVES</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/palm3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2471" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/palm3.jpg" alt="" width="669" height="198" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/palm3.jpg 669w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/palm3-300x89.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" /></a></p>
<p>Check the equity and reserves as on 2017 and 2018 and take in the numbers and the sudden jump, which is due to issuing shares at a premium.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>By now, it is safe to say that this issue is an <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>AVOID</strong></span>.</p>

<p>The company operates in a hugely competitive, low margin business (packaging food and pharma). The competition comes from both organized and unorganized sectors.</p>
<p>It is safe to say there is no moat.</p>
<p>Moreover, the plastics packaging industry&#8217;s profitability depends on crude prices which are red hot. This is another negative.</p>
<p><strong>NEGATIVE CASH FLOWS</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sorich3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2445" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sorich3.jpg" alt="sorich foils cash flow" width="620" height="200" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sorich3.jpg 620w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sorich3-300x97.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>The image above speaks a thousand words. The consolidated flows are bad and the outflows are financed by loans in 5 out of 6 periods.</p>
<p><strong>LACKLUSTER NUMBERS</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sorich4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2446" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sorich4.jpg" alt="sorich foils profit and loss" width="667" height="473" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sorich4.jpg 667w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sorich4-300x213.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></a></p>
<p>The profit and loss does not excite. Point to be noted is that profits have resulted because of inventories.</p>
<p>Credit period extended to debtors is 4+ months.</p>
<p>Inventories held are 33% of sales.</p>
<p>Post issue, capital will be 8.33 crores with no visible signs of sales or profitability increasing. If the company continues reporting 0.90% margins, the EPS will be extremely poor.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>Sorich Foils IPO seems like an <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>AVOID</strong></span>.</p>

<p>Is the IPO worth applying? Find out in our unbiased review:</p>
<p><strong>MOAT:</strong></p>
<p>The company owns a hotel, Hotel Debock Inn, in Tonk, Jaipur.</p>
<p>It sells agricultural equipment manufactured by the promoter&#8217;s proprietorship firm, Eagle Sales.</p>
<p>The company is also into sales and marketing. <a href="http://debockgroup.com/category_services/index/2">I checked their website and it is not mentioned what the company is marketing</a>.</p>
<p>The company has no moat to speak of.</p>
<p><strong>COMPLIANCE ISSUES:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/debock2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2417" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/debock2.jpg" alt="debock sales compliance issues" width="885" height="296" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/debock2.jpg 885w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/debock2-300x100.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/debock2-768x257.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px" /></a></p>
<p>The company has been negligent in complying with statutory flings.</p>
<p><strong>CRIMINAL CASES AGAINST THE PROMOTERS:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/debock.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2416" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/debock.jpg" alt="debock sales criminal cases" width="898" height="462" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/debock.jpg 898w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/debock-300x154.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/debock-768x395.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 898px) 100vw, 898px" /></a></p>
<p>There are 4 criminal cases against the promoter/directors. Also, the promoter has changed his name from Mukesh Kumar Mahawar to Mukesh Manveer Singh. Could it be because of these cases?</p>
<p><strong>GROUP COMPANIES&#8217; LOSSES</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/debock3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2419" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/debock3.jpg" alt="debock sales group company losses" width="881" height="595" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/debock3.jpg 881w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/debock3-300x203.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/debock3-768x519.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 881px) 100vw, 881px" /></a></p>
<p>Other companies associated with the group are in losses.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>I have by now read enough to form an opinion, which is &#8211; <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>AVOID</strong></span>.</p>

Is it worth applying to? Find out in this unbiased review.</p>
<p><strong>MOAT</strong></p>
<p>Post GST, RERA, demonetization, etc., the CA business is on a roll and therefore it is natural to assume that Arihant is in a growing market. It also seems to enjoy a good brand image in Gujarat where it operate a 20000 sft institute and employs several professionals, plus it has franchised out branches too.</p>
<p>It is not known about the competition that the company faces because tutorials are not a regulated business. Moreover, bulk of the operations are localized in Ahmedabad.</p>
<p>It will be safe to say that Arihant has a below-average moat.</p>
<p><strong>CASH FLOWS</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arihant-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2405" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arihant-2.jpg" alt="arihant institute ipo cash flows" width="627" height="239" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arihant-2.jpg 627w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arihant-2-300x114.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px" /></a></p>
<p>The company has experienced negative cash flows right up to 31-1-18. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">This is a red flag</span></strong> because an established institute that says it has a super brand value must report positive operational cash flows.</p>
<p><strong>COMPLIANCE ISSSUES</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Arihant-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2406" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Arihant-3.jpg" alt="arihant institute compliance issues" width="666" height="449" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Arihant-3.jpg 666w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Arihant-3-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px" /></a></p>
<p>The company has not complied with the ROC filings and its directors have been disqualified.</p>
<p>Though non compliance does not result in material financial penalties, it does reflect badly on the company.</p>
<p><b>TRADE RECEIVABLES</b></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arihant-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2407" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arihant-4.jpg" alt="arihant industries debtors" width="739" height="622" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arihant-4.jpg 739w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arihant-4-300x253.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /></a></p>
<p>Typically a training institute collects fees in advance.</p>
<p>In Arihant&#8217;s case, its trade receivables work up to 2.18 crores and its sales are 1.14 crores.</p>
<p>Of the total debtors, Arihant claims 88 lakhs are retained by its franchisees, but are considered good.</p>
<p>The balance debtors work up to 1.3 crores (roughly) and the sales are 1.14 crores, which implies the institute allows a credit period of over 12 months to its students. It is also not clear whether the 1.14 crore sales include franchise sales.</p>
<p>ALSO: The reserves and surplus item is negative.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>At this moment, I have seen enough to suggest this issue is an <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>AVOID</strong></span>. Those of you who are interested should read through the entire prospectus and chat with the management before applying.</p>

Is the issue worth subscribing to? Here&#8217;s an unbiased review:</strong></p>
<p><strong>MOAT:</strong></p>
<p>The company operates a robotics facility (machines/software) that offers turnkey automated solutions (design and prototype) for the automotive industry, and it also creates car parking solutions  for clients in Pune and Mumbai (as in complex car parking systems that you see in malls).</p>
<p>Basically the company gets an order, makes some prototypes, gets the customer&#8217;s sign off and installs the required paraphenalia at the customer&#8217;s plant. It can even set up a new facility for customers.</p>
<p>It is headed by an experienced technocrat, Milind Padole.</p>
<p>For designing parts, the company uses licensed software (it does not own any in-house developed software).</p>
<p>It has collaborations in China, Taiwan and Netherlands, and their PDF also owns a facility in China. It services reputed clients such as Maruti, Volvo, Eicher, M&amp;M, Tata, Ashok Leyland, etc.</p>
<p><strong>One new and very exciting business that the company has entered into is the secondary packaging business which  involves picking up used plastic bottles, refurbishing these, and refilling with water, etc. This type of recycling business has fantastic potential given the problem of plastic waste we face.</strong></p>
<p>Note that the automation business is growing rapidly in India and the space is getting very competitive. Though the company&#8217;s business model looks good especially considering EVs still have to take off, we can say that the moat is above average for now, and its strength will depend on what the company does going forward.</p>
<p><strong>TAX ISSUES:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2379" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-2.jpg" alt="affordable robotics issue graded" width="806" height="266" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-2.jpg 806w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-2-300x99.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-2-768x253.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px" /></a></p>
<p>The company has faced tax issues in the past and has an outstanding demand of Rs 9.55 crore towards direct and indirect taxes. In March 2018, the company paid 3.32 crores and from that date, Rs 6.23 crores may be outstanding. There is no clarity on the current situation, and time will provide the answers.</p>
<p><strong>ERRATIC CASH FLOWS:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2380" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-4.jpg" alt="affordable robotics cash flows" width="784" height="335" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-4.jpg 784w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-4-300x128.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-4-768x328.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see in the image, the company has experienced solid spurts and declines in the cash flows. The reason for this could be the fact that though the company was in automation operations since 2005, the actual work started from 2010. Later, it had to invest in car parking solutions, which now contribute 19% of total turnover. This may have squeezed cash flows.</p>
<p><strong>PRICE TO BOOK VALUE:</strong></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s BV is 17 and the issue price is Rs 85, making it 5 times book, which seems expensive.</p>
<p><strong>PROMOTER&#8217;S COST OF ACQUISITION</strong></p>
<p>The promoters have acquired the stock at 40 paise. Well, this is a normal with all SME IPOs and the low cost of acquisition represents the reward to the promoters for their dynamism. So this should not be a factor.</p>
<p><b>INVENTORIES TO SALES:</b></p>
<p>The inventories work up to to 54% of sales, implying that many orders were in process. Therefore, one factor that needs to be checked post-IPO is whether sales increased.</p>
<p><strong>UTILIZATION OF ISSUE PROCEEDS:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2383" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-3.jpg" alt="affordable robotics issue proceeds" width="784" height="349" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-3.jpg 784w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-3-300x134.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-3-768x342.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px" /></a></p>
<p>From the looks of it, the company would be able to easily resolve its debt and working capital requirements post-issue, which is a good sign.</p>
<p><strong>ISSUE PRICING:</strong></p>
<p>The weighted EPS for the last 3 years works out to Rs 3.85 pre IPO. You can say that the issue is fully priced. The NAV pre-IPO is 17.54 (31-3-17).</p>
<p><strong>COMPETITION:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2384" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-5.jpg" alt="affordable robotics competition" width="822" height="129" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-5.jpg 822w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-5-300x47.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-5-768x121.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px" /></a></p>
<p>According to the prospectus, the company has no listed competitors and therefore peer comparison isn&#8217;t possible.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong>:</p>
<p>Though it seems fully priced, Affordable Robotics &amp; Automation seems to have that X factor that most SME issues lack. The new business of refilling also seems very exciting. The company looks like a medium-long term horse to bet on. Plus, there are high chances of listing gains as well.</p>
