<p>Sector stock analysis helps investors learn about the type of stocks that operators and other biggies are accumulating. The accumulation by the biggies can be anything &#8211; better financial condition for the companies going ahead (long term prospects) or for the for a quick short term trade.</p>
<p>Whatever reason it may be, sectoral analysis helps investors judge how well stocks in the different sectors will perform in the near-long term.</p>
<p>The analysis would be even sharper and trades more profitable if the data was available live, and based on micro sectors.</p>
<p>Well, you&#8217;re in luck, because there is a website that breaks down sectors into micro sectors and helps in your quest.</p>
<p>For example, if the two wheeler segment in the auto sector is trending up, it helps you latch on to two wheeler stocks, and so on.</p>
<p>Before I discuss this website, know that many folks who analyze sectors often refer to sites that give the macro picture.</p>
<p>For example, what use is information that the auto sector is trending up when the sector is up because only 2 wheelers are in an uptrend?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you will agree that analyzing micro sectoral data than analyzing the macro data.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.bseindia.com/markets/Equity/EQReports/industrywatchList.aspx">There is only one website that displays this helpful information &#8211; and it is the BSE.</a></h2>
<p>You also can drill down into any micro sector and figure out the stocks that are performing and separate these from the duds.</p>
<h3>Best of all, it allows analyze information of 111 micro sectors spread over 4 pages!</h3>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>This is how you figure out trending sectors. The next steps would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Figure out the performing stocks per sector.</li>
<li><a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/a-live-trade-setup-that-can-generate-super-profits/">Check their technicals using our setup</a>, or any setup you are comfortable with.</li>

<li>Keep checking every 15 minutes in the live market and at EOD and make a list of stocks that look bullish or bearish (do not forget to check sectors that are trending down so that you can hedge your long bets).</li>
<li>Paper trade and check this strategy out for at least a week before you are convinced of its usefulness.</li>

<p>The best thing about this setup is that you can have a long list of stocks and apply your favorite technicals to each stock with the click of a mouse.</p>
<h2>STEP 1: DISCOVER STOCKS BY ANALYZING OI DATA</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/market-iq/how-to-analyze-open-interest-data-and-generate-profitable-swing-trades/">You&#8217;ll need to learn how to do this and here&#8217;s an article on the subject.</a></strong></p>
<p>Make a list of stocks that look interesting based on Open Interest data. I compiled a sample list based on OI data of 8/6/18 EOD, and am assuming that you know by now how to analyze OI data.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/high-OI-stocks.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2668" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/high-OI-stocks.jpg" alt="how to analyze NSE OI data" width="976" height="864" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/high-OI-stocks.jpg 976w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/high-OI-stocks-300x266.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/high-OI-stocks-768x680.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px" /></a></p>
<p>So, a list of bullish stocks (I&#8217;ve taken about 9+% OI along with a rise in price and volume to be high-probability bullish) across three sectors are:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>IGL, GAIL, Reliance, Indian Bank, Bajaj Finance, Star (Strides Shasun), Wockhardt Pharma.</strong></span></p>
<p>So we now have a sample list of stocks that could do well on Monday. These are the stocks that we must watch on Monday morning and take a chance based on their charts.</p>
<p>Note that this is just a sample list and you probably can figure out more stocks after analyzing all the sectors.</p>
<p>Now remember this: OI keeps changing and therefore you must have it open while you trade. You also must check how it keeps changing and bring new stocks (bullish or bearish) under your radar.</p>
<p>Typically you can start checking OI data from 10 AM onwards and check every 15 minutes or so for changes.</p>
<p>Right, now let&#8217;s check the Options Chain of any one of the shortlisted stocks.</p>
<h2>STEP 2: ANALYZE THE OPTIONS CHAIN DATA</h2>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/options/how-to-analyze-call-and-put-writing-and-predict-trends/"><strong>You will need to learn how to analyze Call and Put Writing signals and this article will help.</strong></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve analyzed the Star (Strides Shasun) options chain and here&#8217;s what it looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/options-OI.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2671" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/options-OI.jpg" alt="options for intra day trades" width="1017" height="509" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/options-OI.jpg 1017w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/options-OI-300x150.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/options-OI-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1017px) 100vw, 1017px" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my analysis:</p>
<p>The stock is at 357.</p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> Call writers are squaring up their positions at 360CE 28 June 2018. You can see OI for that CE is down by 10,200. This implies that the writers are afraid to short the 360CE <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and therefore the chances of the stock moving higher look bright</strong></span>.</p>
<p><strong>(b) </strong>Call writers are happy about selling 380CE, 400CE and higher CEs for the same expiry implying that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they don&#8217;t see the stock moving beyond 380-400 up to 28 June</strong></span>.</p>
<p><strong>(c) </strong>Put writers are unafraid of writing 360 and below PEs, and you can also see that most Put buyers have lost money (while most CE buyers have made money). This implies thatÂ <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the writers don&#8217;t see the stock falling much from current levels up to 28 June</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, Star or Strides Shasun looks like a bullish trade in the short term (BTST to 4-5 days). Of course, with a strict stop loss.</p>
<p>Now, we have a probable trades for Monday and so set up the charts.</p>
<h2>STEP 3: SET UP THE CHARTS</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s make a list of all the stocks mentioned above to check on the charts on Monday.</p>
<p>Open <strong><a href="https://in.investing.com/">Investing.com</a></strong>, and sign in to your free account.</p>
<p>Hover the mouse over your Name in the member bar at the top and choose &#8220;Portfolio&#8221; from the drop down.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Investing.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2674" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Investing.jpg" alt="how to setup for a day trade" width="847" height="358" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Investing.jpg 847w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Investing-300x127.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Investing-768x325.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p>
<p>Once you are in the portfolio section, enter the stocks you have selected.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/investing-portfolio-charts.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2675" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/investing-portfolio-charts.jpg" alt="how to set up portfolio on charts" width="986" height="541" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/investing-portfolio-charts.jpg 986w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/investing-portfolio-charts-300x165.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/investing-portfolio-charts-768x421.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/investing-portfolio-charts-120x67.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px" /></a></p>
<p>Now click on any one symbol. I&#8217;m clicking on Strides Shasun as it is used as an an example in this post.</p>
<p>Now click on the &#8220;Charts&#8221; tab and it will open the chart for the first stock inn the list.</p>
<p>Expand the chart to full screen mode.</p>
<p>Apply the indicators suggested in our trade setup (Ichimoku, Supertrend, 20-50 0r 13-48 EMA, MACD).</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/a-live-trade-setup-that-can-generate-super-profits/">Also read up our trade setup to understand how a combination of this indicators work</a></strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trade-setup-multiple-stocks.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2676" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trade-setup-multiple-stocks.jpg" alt="day trading setup" width="986" height="481" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trade-setup-multiple-stocks.jpg 986w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trade-setup-multiple-stocks-300x146.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trade-setup-multiple-stocks-768x375.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px" /></a></p>
<p>Notice that all the stocks that you have added in the portfolio get featured on the right.</p>
<p>You can add as many stocks as you like and keep deleting stocks that no longer interest you.</p>
<h2>STEP 4: ANALYZE THE CHARTS</h2>
<p>As an example I&#8217;ve analyzed Strides Shasun 1-Hour chart as this period is ideal for a swing trade analysis.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strides-chart.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2677" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strides-chart.jpg" alt="how to analyze 1 hour charts" width="1358" height="661" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strides-chart.jpg 1358w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strides-chart-300x146.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strides-chart-768x374.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strides-chart-1024x498.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1358px) 100vw, 1358px" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;re my observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Supertrend indicated a buy at 358 and the stock hit 370+ before reacting back to 357. In any case, SuperTrend gives good entries but is late on exits.</li>
<li>The 20 EMA is still below 50 EMA and this is not a bullish sign.</li>
<li>The price is below the Ichimoku cloud, base lines and the EMAs. This data implies that the stock is in a downtrend.</li>
<li>The 1-Day and 1-Week charts too suggest that the stock is in a bear grip.</li>
<li>The MACD line is drooping as well. Not a good sign.</li>
<li>The Options Chain, on the other hand, indicates bullishness and the possibility of the stock hitting between 360-380 in the short run.</li>
<li>The OI data too is bullish.</li>
<li><strong>The charts are contrasting with the Options and OI data</strong>. Typically, the action starts in the derivatives before hitting the cash market.</li>
<li>So, while it makes sense watching Strides Shashun on the charts, it also makes sense to try a long strangle in the options by buyingÂ  PE and CE at ITM (In The Money) prices. This is because Strides Shasun looks very volatile give the divergent views of the derivatives and the charts data. <a href="https://bullbull.in/options/long-strangle-options-strategy-for-volatile-stocks/">This post helps you understand what a long strangle is</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>STEP 5: USING THIS SETUP</h2>
<ol>
<li>Revise the setup at the end of day, before every trading day.</li>
<li>Be ready with list of stocks at 9.15 AM and by then you should know the stocks with the highest potential to move either way.</li>
<li>Start checking the OI and Options Chain data every 15 minutes starting from 10.30 AM for OI and 10 AM for the Options data.</li>
<li>Keep adding or deleting stocks to the Investing.com portfolio per your analyses.</li>
<li>Keep analysing charts by switching between stocks. Additionally you can set up alerts per stock so that you know when stock prices touch your target.</li>
<li>Repeat.Perform a few paper trades to get a hang of this style. Good luck.</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#8217;ve taken a jewelry company as a case study because it will help you catch the areas that need to be focused on.</p>
<p>However, this article is not just about that companyÂ  &#8211; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the goal of this post is to inform you that it is COMPULSORY to read the Annual Report (AR) before buying a stock.</strong></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve correlated different finance heads and applied common sense, because it is all boils down to common sense and a very basic understanding of business.</p>
<p>Here are some areas that seemed glaringly out of the place:</p>
<h2>SHORT TERM LIQUIDITY</h2>
<p>Any company must have the capacity to meet short-term obligations.</p>
<p>If the company does not have enough liquid assets to pay short term liabilities, it shows inefficient cash management.</p>
<p>(Cash + Investments + Debtors)Â  which are liquid assets, must exceed Current Liabilities (trade payables, short term borrowings and other current liabilities that are payable)</p>
<p>Inventories do not count becauseÂ selling these will seriously impair its business.</p>
<p>Also, if at all it has to sell inventory then it will take time and huge losses because no one will buy stock in trade at market rates.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s take a look at this company&#8217;s short term liquidity:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/QR.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2645 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/QR.jpg" alt="quick ratio explained with examples" width="616" height="542" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/QR.jpg 616w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/QR-300x264.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Investments + Debtors + Cash/Bank + Other Liquid assets = </b><b>2511 </b><b>crores</b></p>
<p><b>Short term borrowing + Creditors + other short term liabilities = </b><b>3785 </b><b>crores</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>So if thereâs a run on this company, it would have beenÂ </b><b>short 1274 </b></span><b><span style="color: #ff0000;">crores</span>.</b></p>
<p>There are comments below that gold could be sold to meet the shortfall. But if the company starts selling its gold, it won&#8217;t get the market price and would incur a loss. Moreover it would jeopardize their business and the brand name.</p>
<h2>INTEREST ON BORROWINGS</h2>
<p>Typically a company obtains long term loans to invest in capital assets and short term loans to finance the working capital.</p>
<p>The interest on long term loans is lower than the interest on short term loans. Given the present day interest regime (mid 2018), the rate of interest would work up to a maximum of about 13%.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s now check how much this company has paid:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings3.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2649 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings3.jpg" alt="interest analysis" width="596" height="290" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings3.jpg 596w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings3-300x146.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /></a></p>
<p>It has paid 274 crores on account of interest. Now let&#8217;s check its loans:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2648" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings.jpg" alt="pc jewellers borrowings loans" width="596" height="290" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings.jpg 596w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings-300x146.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /></a></p>
<p>It has obtained loans of Rs 634 crores.</p>
<p><b>Interest Paid for the year = </b><b>275 </b><b>crores on loan of 634 crores.Â </b></p>
<p><u><b>Works out to a 43.35% rate of interest. Looks abnormal.</b></u></p>
<p>There were tweets that the company takes gold on lease instead of buying stock. And then someone tweeted that jewelry company take gold leases and therefore let&#8217;s explore that angle as well:</p>
<p>So let us work out how much the company took gold on lease.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/revival-of-gold-on-lease-to-benefit-titan-pc-jewellers-more-115021900888_1.html">Many companies take gold on lease from banks and the rate of interest is about 5% to 8%</a>.</p>
<p>Standalone sales are 8105 crores. Exports make up 34%.</p>
<p>Cost of goods sold is 7400 crores. It is not specified in this account head how much represents making charges, and how much are purchases of gold.</p>
<p>Now, making is a value add activity and it should result in a higher profit margin. But if you correlate the cost of goods sold to the sales, we get a margin of 9% on standalone basis. Therefore, it can be safe to assume that the the cost of goods sold includes purchases of gold and diamonds.</p>
<p>Now, in a gold lease, the bank leases gold to the jewelry maker and in turn the jewelry maker has to secure the bank with some collateral that covers the cost of the gold.</p>
<p>Now let us assume that this company took gold on lease and it was shown in the inventory (asset).</p>
<p>Will it not be safe to assume that the bank demanded a collateral and the company created some charge on FDs or some other assets?</p>
<p>It will be safe to make this assumption.Â  Let&#8217;s look at the companies assets (standalone) (no major divergences in consolidated figures).</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pcj007.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2658 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pcj007.jpg" alt="assets analysis" width="929" height="602" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pcj007.jpg 929w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pcj007-300x194.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pcj007-768x498.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px" /></a></p>
<p>Which asset could have been pledged against the gold leases?</p>
<p>The investments represent investment in a subsidiary &#8211; THIS CANNOT BE PLEDGED</p>
<p>The loans represent loans to related parties &#8211; THESE CANNOT BE PLEDGED</p>
<p>Deferred assets, trade receivables, loans CANNOT BE PLEDGED.</p>
<p>Other assets represent mostly prepaid expenses &#8211; CANNOT BE PLEDGED</p>
<p>Inventories are assumed to have been taken on lease &#8211;Â CANNOT BE PLEDGED</p>
<p>Cash is required for the business &#8211; CANNOT BE PLEDGED</p>
<p>Bank Balance is 555 crores and is represented by deposits below 3 months. This CAN BE PLEDGED.</p>
<p>Therefore I am assuming that 555 crores or thereabouts is the value of the gold leases and assuming the highest rate of interest @ 8%, which is 44 crores.</p>
<p>THEREFORE THE TOTAL INTEREST PAID CAN BE ABOUT 10% ON 634 CRORE (LOANS) <strong>plus </strong>THE ASSUMED INTEREST ON GOLD LEASES OF 44 CRORES.</p>
<p>Note that though gold leases are for a short period, I am assuming the company kept rolling over gold leases and obtained 555 crores for 1 year and paid the highest rate of interest.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Therefore the total interest that I can assume is about Rs 107 crores while the interest provided is Rs 274 crores. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Even if you assume 1% LC charges on exports booked as interest, we can add another 27 crores to the interest taking it to 134 crores, while the interest paid is 274 crores.Â </strong></span></p>
<p><b>INFERENCE: OBVIOUSLY THERE IS SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT ADD UP.</b></p>
<h2>INVENTORY LEVELS</h2>
<p>Sales for the YE 31.3.17 are 8104 crores</p>
<p>The cost of sales isÂ 7409 crores, which implies that this company makes about 9% gross profit margin.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2650" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory.jpg" alt="what is inventory ratio" width="611" height="317" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory.jpg 611w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory-300x156.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" /></a></p>
<p>Inventory as on 31-3-17 is 4119 crores. Let us add 9% and reconcile it with the selling rate. We get inventory atÂ 4526 crores at market prices.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2651 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory-2.jpg" alt="why is inventory to turnover ratio important" width="611" height="228" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory-2.jpg 611w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory-2-300x112.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" /></a></p>
<p>Every company holds inventory in the hope of selling it quickly and turning around the cash with which it can do more business.</p>
<p>Heavy inventories are a sign of inefficient inventory management.</p>
<p>In the case of this company, the inventory held represents 6.5 months of sale. This is an extraordinarily high level of inventory and a sign that inventory management needs to sharpen up .</p>
<p><b>Remember that high value inventory like jewelry and diamonds are surrounded by negative factors such as high storage costs,Â  fear of theft, interest to pay, etc.</b></p>
<p>Clearly, the 6.5 months of inventory seems high.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>There is a comment below that you need this kind of inventory in the jewelry business.</strong> </span></p>
<p>Let us take the case of <strong>Titan</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Sales 12717 crores</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inventory 4807 crores</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s 4.5 months of inventory for 640+ jewelry and Fasttrack stores. The company in this example has 75 stores and remember, 34% of its products are exported.Â  <strong>Titan</strong> too exports but I don&#8217;t have the percentage at this moment.</p>
<p>In any case, I do feel that in the Jewelry business an inventory of 4.5 to 5 months is acceptable. Anything over that suggests that operations must be optimized.</p>
<h2>MARKET CAPITALIZATION TO TOTAL LIABILITIES</h2>
<p>Actually, thisÂ  check wouldn&#8217;t have applied last year when the this company&#8217;s AR was released and its its stock price was very high that time.</p>
<p>However, you should apply it to all companies in the news for the wrong reasons to get a understanding of what would happen to them if there&#8217;s a run on their finances.</p>
<p><b>The current market cap of this company = 2450Â </b><b>crores</b><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>TotalÂ  Liabilities = 3850 </b><b>crores</b><b><br />
(excl </b><b>equity</b><b> cap + reserves)</b></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mcap.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2654" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mcap.jpg" alt="mcap to total liabilities" width="592" height="317" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mcap.jpg 592w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mcap-300x161.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /></a></p>
<p><b>INFERENCE: There&#8217;s a shortfall of 1400 crores, which means that the confidence of investors in this company&#8217;s assets is not high. This correlation shows how much the company&#8217;s assets can possibly decline in value in case there&#8217;s a run on it.</b></p>
<h2>CASH FLOW</h2>
<p>By now you would have realized that this company was holding very high inventory levels, paying a high rate of interest and its short term liquidity was not good.</p>
<p>What should this company do in such circumstances?</p>
<p>Use cash for optimizing operations, wiping off debt, etc.</p>
<p>Therefore let&#8217;s check the company&#8217;s cash flow statement.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cash-flow.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2655 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cash-flow.jpg" alt="cash flow" width="610" height="526" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cash-flow.jpg 610w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cash-flow-300x259.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></a></p>
<p><b>The company has invested in a subsidiary and handed over a loan to a group company, both transactions amounting to 293 </b><b>crores, and it ended up taking a new loan (net) ofÂ </b><b>Â </b><b>1</b><b>80 </b><b>crores to fund the transactions.</b></p>
<p><b>INFERENCE: Cash management does not meet accepted norms.</b></p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>Would you have invested in this company last year when it was peaking even after analyzing this information?</p>
<p>Of course, you wouldn&#8217;t have.</p>

<p>Do you know what anÂ Out-Of-The-Money Option is?</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/options/the-basics-of-options-trading/"><strong>If you are unfamiliar with options terms, read this article first</strong></a>.</p>
<p>If you buy out-of-the-money options at unreasonable premiums or at far away strike prices, an Options Writer will consider you to be an extremely rash trader. This is being politely.</p>
<p>To be blunt, he regards you as an idiot trader but nevertheless loves you, because&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>AN OPTIONS WRITER MAKES HIS MONEY BY EATING PREMIUMS FROM THE OPTIONS HE WRITES (SELLS).</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE OPTIONS WRITER ALSO KNOWS THAT <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AT LEAST 50%</span> OF OPTIONS EXPIRE WITHOUT BEING EXERCISED</strong>. So, if he plays it right, his chances of making profits are up at least 50% even before he starts writing.</p>
<p>The Options Writer is an extremely sharp trader who works with tools that constantly update him on the profit or loss potential of the option he has sold.</p>
<p>We will get to these tools at the end of the article. Let&#8217;s start:</p>
<h2>SECRETS OF OPTIONS WRITERS</h2>
<p><strong>1:</strong> Options writers know that shorting options is a dangerous game and therefore <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they largely square up their position by the end of the day</strong> </span>unless the profit margin is massive (in which case they set a higher Stop Loss in the next trading session).</p>
<p><strong>2:</strong> Options writers <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>always judge the trend</strong></span>. If the trend is bearish, theyÂ <strong>Write Call Options.</strong></p>
<p>If the trend is bullish, they <strong>WriteÂ Put Options.</strong></p>
<p>As an example, the trend these days (1-6-18) is that Nifty stocks are rising while the midcaps are falling. So the Options Writers will be active writing calls of FNO stocks that do not feature in the Nifty.</p>
<p>Similarly, when a particular sector becomes a hot topic of discussion, like in the case of consumer durable stocks a couple of weeks back, the Options Writers will write Put options of such stocks and indices.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important to judge the market trend if you are a Options Writer.</p>
<p><strong>3:</strong>Â These writers <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>love stocks that are not volatile</strong></span>.</p>
<p>The idea is to eat premiums on OTM calls and non volatile stocks do not fluctuate much and therefore writers are not too worried about writing both calls and puts.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take the example of Infosys which is around 1100. If the annual volatility of the stock is around 10%, it means that the stock will fluctuate in a band of 990-1210 in a year. This implies a fluctuation of Rs 110 either way in a year, which works out to about Rs 9 per month.</p>
<p>So, in such a case the writers are emboldened to write both puts and calls of 1080 (and below) and 1120 (and above) for a given day and walk away with the premiums. Of course if there&#8217;s a massive fluctuation in Infosys, they will lose. But by and large this strategy works out in 8/10 stocks.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They also love to sell strangles in non-volatile stocks</strong></span>. A strangle is a strategy in which a trader buys an OTM PE and CE of a volatile stock because he expects the combined premium to move up. In non-volatile stock, the reverse happens (premium moves down)..</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/options/how-to-discover-volatile-and-not-volatile-stocks-for-applying-options-strategies/"><strong>Now the question is how to discover volatility per stock and for that you must refer this article</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>4:</strong>Â Options writers <strong>do NOT focus on just one or two stocks</strong>.</p>
<p>Writing calls and puts for many stocks (some non-volatile, some at overpriced premiums, some at far away strike prices) hedges their risk.</p>
<p>Therefore, the goal is to diversify and not get hooked on to a couple of stocks. Also, writers are cold, calculative and unemotional people.</p>
<p><strong>5:</strong>Â Options writers write at strike prices that areÂ  aboutÂ <strong>15% Out of the Money</strong></p>
<p>Typically, the option writer correlates volatility to the time value of the option. The assumption is that by now you know how to measure volatility (see link above).</p>
<p>If you are yet unfamiliar with the terms, start again and read the Options Basics article that I have linked to.</p>
<p>The Options Writer selects options that are significantly out of the money because he knows that the stock will move up hugely only if there&#8217;s a massive move.</p>
<p>OTM Options whose strike prices are +/-15% will likely not be exercised and therefore there are high chances of such options making money for the Writer.</p>
<p><strong>6:</strong>Â Options writers also love to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>write options when the premium is overpriced</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Now remember this &#8211; the Options Writer is mostly looking to square up his position by the end of the day, so he doesn&#8217;t care what happens tomorrow.</p>
<p>Therefore, he will calculate the fair value of the stock or index (underlying) and if he finds that the premiums are overpriced, he will write the option even though its strike price is closer to the CMP.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They typically write options that are more than 20% overpriced</strong></span>.</p>
<p>These writers have <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>sophisticated surveillance tools</strong></span> that alert them about overpriced premiums, about their live profit and loss position, and cases where premiums begin to spike.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t and therefore you can use online tools to determine if the premium is fair or not. <a href="https://bullbull.in/option-premium-value/"><strong>One such tool is located here</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> Finally, you need to understand <strong>Options Greeks, which are made up of delta, gamma, vega, theta and rho.</strong></p>
<p>Option writers use their values to figure out trades.</p>
<p>This is a rather long topic and I&#8217;ll write a post about it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can start doing paper trades from the knowledge you gathered if you want to become an Options Writer. It will take you at least a month and several paper trades to get the hang of the trade.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you are a plain vanilla investor or an options buyer, then use the information above to understand what to do and what not to do.</p>

<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/market-iq/how-to-analyze-open-interest-data-and-generate-profitable-swing-trades/"><strong>To understand the basic concept of Open Interest (OI), please read through this article</strong></a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now assuming that you now know how OI is calculated and that you know the implications.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 1: <a href="https://www.nseindia.com/live_market/dynaContent/live_watch/option_chain/optionKeys.jsp">Let&#8217;s open the Nifty Options Chain Page for 28 June 2017</a>:</strong></p>
<p>Date: <strong>1 June 2018</strong> &#8211; Time <strong>1.27 PM</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nifty-OPTION-CHAIN.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2554" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nifty-OPTION-CHAIN.jpg" alt="How to analyze options chain" width="1258" height="735" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nifty-OPTION-CHAIN.jpg 1258w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nifty-OPTION-CHAIN-300x175.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nifty-OPTION-CHAIN-768x449.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nifty-OPTION-CHAIN-1024x598.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1258px) 100vw, 1258px" /></a></p>
<p>Note the shaded portion (in light pink tones, both on the left and on the right).</p>
<p><strong>It represents In The Money Strike Prices</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is what In The Money and Out of The Money Strike Prices imply:</p>
<p><strong>A. In the Money (ITM)</strong></p>
<p><strong>â (For Call options)Â </strong>When strike price is below the stock price. Example, if you buy Nifty 10200CE and the spot price is 10700.</p>
<p><strong>â (For Put options)Â </strong>When strike price is above the stock price.Â Example, if you buy Nifty 10800PE and the spot price is 10700.</p>
<p><strong>At the Money (ATM)Â âÂ </strong>When strike price is equal to the stock price.Â Example, if you buy Nifty 10700CE or PE and the spot price is 10700.</p>
<p><strong>B. Out of the Money (OTM)</strong></p>
<p><strong>â (For Call options)Â </strong>When strike price is above the stock price.Â Example, if you buy Nifty 10800CE and the spot price is 10700.</p>
<p><strong>â (For Put options)Â </strong>When strike price is below the stock price.Â Example, if you buy Nifty 10500PE and the spot price is 10700.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Understand the concepts of Call and Put Writing</strong></p>
<p>A writer of a call or a put is a seller.</p>
<p>He sells both calls and puts because he feels the strike prices won&#8217;t hit and he will earn the premium. He also assumes that any buyer of an OTM call or Put is a rash trader.</p>
<p>This is why call and put writers are very active in Out-of-the-Money strike prices, and this is where we must get our clues from.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Copy the Data and paste on an Excel Sheet</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve copied all data and pasted it on an Excel sheet focusing on strike prices between 10050 and 11200.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-OI.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2556" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-OI.jpg" alt="how to read option chain" width="966" height="452" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-OI.jpg 966w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-OI-300x140.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-OI-768x359.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Interpret The OTM Call WritingÂ </strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve highlighted the rows which saw the maximum addition.</p>
<ol>
<li>10,800 CE added 118,527 volume to OI making the OI balloon to 2,182,500 &#8211; this means call writers are reasonably confident that Nifty will have a very tough time crossing 10,800.</li>
<li>10,900 CE added 745,800 volume, ballooning the OI to 2,207, 850Â &#8211; this means call writers are reasonably confident that Nifty will also have a very tough time crossing 10,900.</li>
<li>The call writers also felt that crossing 11,000 CEÂ  is another tough call judging from the fact that 92,110 volume was added to OI taking it to 3,782,625. The change in OI was highest at 11,000 indicating that writers were supremely confident that it was almost impossible for the Nifty to cross 11,000.</li>
</ol>
<p>As of today, the call writers feel that Nifty will face it extremely tough to cross 10,800 and beyond, and therefore are happily selling (writing) calls.</p>
<p>It may be that this position gets reversed tomorrow (for example, oil can drop $5, or government can announce a PSU divestment program, etc.). If the position gets reversed, these call writers will get trapped and will have to cover their shorts.</p>
<p>If it comes to covering their shorts, Nifty has the capability of shooting beyond 11,200 purely based on short covering.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Interpret The OTM Put WritingÂ </strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve highlighted the rows which saw the maximum addition.</p>
<ol>
<li>10,600 PE added 97,667 volume taking OI to 3,473,925. This is the highest OI on the Put side and it implies that Put writersÂ are more or less confident that Nifty will not crack 10,600. Note that there was a spurt in OI added, which implies that sellers are very confident not breaking 10,600.</li>
<li>10,700 PE added 90,592Â volume taking OI to 2,153,625. It implies that Put writersÂ are more or less confident that Nifty will not crack 10,650. The addition to OI at this Put Strike price wasÂ 894,900, which shows the confidence of the Put writers.</li>
</ol>
<p>As of today, put writers feel that Nifty will face it extremely tough to break 10,600 and below, and therefore are happily selling (writing) puts between 10600-10700.</p>
<p>It may be that this position gets reversed tomorrow (for example, Shiv Sena and JDU can ditch the BJP, or oil can rise $5/barrel, etc.). If the position gets reversed, these put writers will get trapped and will have to cover their shorts.</p>
<p>If it comes to covering their shorts, Nifty has the capability of falling below 10,600 and possibly up to 10,200 which represents the next confidence level of the put writers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Checking the position on the Charts</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/a-live-trade-setup-that-can-generate-super-profits/">Please read this article before reading the analysis</a>.</p>
<p><strong>a. The 1 Week Charts of the Nifty at 2.58 PM</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-Chain-on-char.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2560" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-Chain-on-char.jpg" alt="how to chart check options OI" width="1347" height="570" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-Chain-on-char.jpg 1347w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-Chain-on-char-300x127.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-Chain-on-char-768x325.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-Chain-on-char-1024x433.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1347px) 100vw, 1347px" /></a></p>
<p>Though Supertrend suggests a weak trend, you can see that the Nifty is very close to breaking the Supertrend barrier.</p>
<p>The Nifty also hasn&#8217;t broken the Ichimoku Base and Conversion Lines.</p>
<p>The 20Day EMA is still higher than the 50-day EMA.</p>
<p>The MACD Line has crossed above the Signal Line and that is another bullish signal.</p>
<p>Therefore I would say the weekly chart is bullish.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2564" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o.jpg" alt="nifty hourly charts for options" width="1347" height="570" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o.jpg 1347w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o-300x127.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o-768x325.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o-1024x433.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1347px) 100vw, 1347px" /></a>b. The 1 Day Charts of the Nifty at 2.58 PM</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-Chain-on-charts.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2563" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-Chain-on-charts.jpg" alt="how to extrapolate options OI on charts" width="1347" height="570" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-Chain-on-charts.jpg 1347w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-Chain-on-charts-300x127.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-Chain-on-charts-768x325.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-Chain-on-charts-1024x433.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1347px) 100vw, 1347px" /></a></p>
<p>Super trend is bearish but the Nifty can easily breakout on a gap up opening, or a reasonable rise during a trading day.</p>
<p>The Nifty is still above the Ichimoku Base and Conversion Lines.</p>
<p>The MACD suggests a bullish signal.</p>
<p>The 20D EMA is above the 50D EMA.</p>
<p>It is easy to tell Nifty is an uptrend.</p>
<p><strong>c. The 1 Hour Charts of the Nifty at 2.58 PM</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2564" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o.jpg" alt="nifty hourly charts for options" width="1347" height="570" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o.jpg 1347w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o-300x127.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o-768x325.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o-1024x433.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1347px) 100vw, 1347px" /></a></p>
<p>3 indicators (Supertrend, Ichimoku and EMAs) suggest an uptrend while the MACD seems weak, but has not turned bearish.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Reconciling Options OI with Charts</strong></p>
<p>The Options OI for the 28 June 2018 expiry suggests that call and put writers estimate that the Nifty would move in a range f 10600 to 10900.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s do one thing &#8211; let&#8217;s measure the total call and put writers in a (+) (-) 200 to 300 points range.</p>
<p>The Nifty is currently at 10696 (3.30 PM).</p>
<p>The total number of Put Writers between 10450-10700 are 8,948,550.</p>
<p>The total number of Call Writers between 10800-11000 are 8,392,050.</p>
<p>Put Writers exceed Call Writers and therefore the writers are more confident in selling OTM PEs.</p>
<p>So, the analysis is that the writers expect the market to be in the 10600-10900 range and the charts suggest that the markets are more bullish than bearish.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Deciding what to do</strong></p>
<p>After analysis, I would buy an In-The-Money or At-The-Money CE for June Expiry and hold with a SL for 2-3 days.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Anticipating The Change In Trend</strong></p>
<p>This article was written on 1 June 2018 and the expiry is on 28 June. It is possible that the trend changes quickly and therefore you should assume this trend is valid for 2-3 days.</p>
<h2><strong>You can try this strategy on any FNO stock. The chances of success will be greater than that of failure, but you should always work with stop losses.</strong></h2>

<p>It will help you discover trending stocks, analyze their charts and then enter into an intraday trade that can hold good for the very short term to up to 6 weeks.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start:</p>
<p><strong>A: SET UP A SCREENER</strong></p>
<p>I use <a href="https://chartink.com/screener/ema-golden-cross-1">Chartink</a>, but you can use any screener of your choice.</p>
<p>The criteria used is a variant of the Golden Cross that many traders follow.</p>
<p>The Screener I have set up triggers a call when the 13 Day EMA crosses above the 48 Day EMA.</p>
<p>Yes, it is a very simple screener because the thorough analysis is done on the charts.</p>
<p><strong>B. SIGNAL VALIDITY</strong></p>
<p>The signal holds good mostly for intraday trades but can work out for short term trades.</p>
<p>For example, I had tweeted about Godrej Consumer Products at 1103 a few days back and L&amp; T (1360)/Indian Hotels (141)/BSE (832) a day ago. All these stocks were discovered using this scanner along with <strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/market-iq/how-to-analyze-open-interest-data-and-generate-profitable-swing-trades/">reading OI data</a></strong>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Track Godrej Consumer Products tomorrow on the charts.. it is likely that it will break resistance if markets are steady or up. The chart is #3 out of 4 charts. <a href="https://t.co/OuIliLiEjp">pic.twitter.com/OuIliLiEjp</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Sunil Tinani (@TheBullBull) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBullBull/status/999310115969949697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Track L&amp;T, BSE, Indian Hotels on charts using our trade setup<a href="https://t.co/6j6csgqo1z">https://t.co/6j6csgqo1z</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Sunil Tinani (@TheBullBull) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBullBull/status/1000972292602511361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><strong>On 29-5-18</strong>: Godrej Consumer hit 1143 , L&amp;T jumped to 1420, Indian Hotels 148 and BSE continues to languish.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><strong>If you see profits intra day, you should book. If you are carrying your position forward, you must work with strict stop losses.</strong></span></p>
<p>Note that in some cases the signal can hold good even for the medium and long term, but that will hold true for 2 out of 10 stocks. Therefore, it is best to use it for intraday trades extending it to a short term trade only if you are 100% convinced.</p>
<p><strong>C. WHAT TIME TO START SCREENING</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can start at 9.20 to 9.30 AM to catch early trends.</strong></p>
<p>I scanned at 9.20 AM and got the following stocks:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2496" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery1.jpg" alt="how to pick stocks" width="958" height="254" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery1.jpg 958w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery1-300x80.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery1-768x204.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" /></a></p>
<p>Out of the stocks screened, 4 were down and Remsons had hit the UC, leaving us with India Glycols.</p>
<p>I tweeted about the stock just to keep track:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Track (watch on charts or do a paper trade)</p>
<p>India Glycols</p>
<p>&mdash; Sunil Tinani (@TheBullBull) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBullBull/status/1001309975984001024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>At 9.30 AM I ran another scan and got the following trends:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2498" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery2.jpg" alt="how to discover trending stocks" width="955" height="219" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery2.jpg 955w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery2-300x69.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery2-768x176.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px" /></a></p>
<p>So at 9.30 AM, I now have 3 stocks to track:</p>
<p>India Glycols, Bodal Chemicals and to a lesser extent GHCL. This is because the volumes in GHCL are not significant enough.</p>
<p>Armed with this information let&#8217;s do a chart check:</p>
<p><strong>D. CHART CHECK</strong></p>
<p>We should do three checks:</p>
<p>One Hour &#8211; To determine if the stock is a buy</p>
<p>One Day &#8211; to determine the short term trend</p>
<p>One Week &#8211; to determine the overall trend</p>
<p>Now before you check the charts, <strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/a-live-trade-setup-that-can-generate-super-profits/">please read this article</a> </strong>and set up the following indicators:</p>
<p>a. Supertrend<br />
b. Ichimoku<br />
c. MACD</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s analyze each pick per time period:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2500" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery3.jpg" alt="how to read one hour charts" width="1346" height="659" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery3.jpg 1346w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery3-300x147.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery3-768x376.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery3-1024x501.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1346px) 100vw, 1346px" /></a></p>
<p>On the one hour charts, all three stocks are trending up and the ST has signaled a buy for all of them yesterday.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2501" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery4.jpg" alt="how to be a stock picker" width="1346" height="659" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery4.jpg 1346w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery4-300x147.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery4-768x376.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery4-1024x501.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1346px) 100vw, 1346px" /></a></p>
<p>On the one day charts, Bodal and GHCL are a clear buy. India Glycols is a sell but if you look at the MACD indicator, you will see that the MACD line is about to cross the Signal Line from below the Zero Line, which if it does, it will be an extremely bullish signal.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would not consider India Glycols to be in a bear grip. Now let&#8217;s move on t the weekly charts.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/how-to-draw-a-trendline-a-step-by-step-guide/"><strong>You may want to read this article before analyzing the weekly period charts</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2502" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery5.jpg" alt="become an expert stock picker" width="1346" height="659" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery5.jpg 1346w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery5-300x147.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery5-768x376.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery5-1024x501.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1346px) 100vw, 1346px" /></a></p>
<p>Since I can draw trendlines in my sleep, I don&#8217;t have to draw them here to know that all three stocks are in a medium-to-long-term uptrend. However you should draw trendlines for learning purposes.</p>
<p>So our chart analysis is good for all three stocks and</p>
<p><strong>E. RESULTS (AT 11.18 AM)</strong></p>
<p>Let us assume we took positions in all the three stocks at the rate we were alerted</p>
<p>The alert for INDIA GLYCOLS was generated at 533 (see image above). It touched 541 and is currently at 532.</p>
<p>The alert for BODAL was generated at 136.60 (see image above). It touched 140 and is currently at 136.90.</p>
<p>The alert for GHCL was generated at 282.55 (see image above). It touched 287 and is currently at 284.50.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #008000;"><strong>ALL THREE RESULTS GENERATED GAINS SO LONG PROFITS WERE BOOKED INTRA DAY!</strong></span></p>
<p>This is why I have suggested quick entries and exits and preferably booking intra day gains even though the stocks look good for a short term hold based on their daily and weekly charts.</p>

<p>&mdash; alok and shashi (@jawsshashi) <a href="https://twitter.com/jawsshashi/status/1000385360638210049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 26, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>So, well, this post will help you discover volatile AND steady stocks on which you can apply Options Strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Before we move ahead, you should read up on the following Options strategies:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/options/long-strangle-options-strategy-for-volatile-stocks/"><strong>LONG STRANGLE</strong></a> (works only on volatile stocks)</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/options/protective-collar-strategy/"><strong>PROTECTIVE COLLAR STRATEGY</strong></a> (works only on stocks that are expected to be steady in the short term and bullish in the long term)</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/options/short-strangle-options-strategy-for-steady-stocks/">SHORT STRANGLE</a></strong> (works only on stocks that are expected to be steady in the near term. Note that this is a slightly risky strategy as it involves shorting.</p>
<h3><strong>HOW TO DISCOVER VOLATILE AND STEADY STOCKS</strong></h3>
<p><strong>METHOD 1: NSE WEBSITE</strong></p>
<p>A. Open</p>
<p>Open <strong><a href="https://www.nseindia.com/products/content/all_daily_reports.htm">NSE Daily Reports</a></strong> and select â<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Derivatives</strong></span>â Tab</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Voolatile1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2481" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Voolatile1.jpg" alt="how to find volatile stocks" width="967" height="488" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Voolatile1.jpg 967w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Voolatile1-300x151.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Voolatile1-768x388.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 967px) 100vw, 967px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Choose âHistorical Volatilityâ in the Derivatives section</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Volatile2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2482" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Volatile2.jpg" alt="how to read NSE derivatives data" width="769" height="413" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Volatile2.jpg 769w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Volatile2-300x161.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Volatile2-768x412.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" /></a></p>
<p>When that page opens, choose &#8220;<strong>Daily Volatility Files,</strong>&#8221; select the previous trading date and download the file.</p>
<p>It will be a CSV file. Open it in Excel, select all rows and columns, and now sort <strong>Column G</strong> from &#8220;<strong>largest to smallest</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/volatile-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2483" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/volatile-3.jpg" alt="NSE volatile stocks data download" width="1350" height="344" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/volatile-3.jpg 1350w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/volatile-3-300x76.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/volatile-3-768x196.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/volatile-3-1024x261.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1350px) 100vw, 1350px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>In our example, PC Jewellers, RCom, R Naval, Star and JP Associates are the most volatile. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The least </strong>volatile stocks will feature at the bottom of the stock. Remember not to consider Indices and stocks that feature in volatile sectors (For example, HDFC Bank volatility was among the lowest, but it sees days of massive volatility because it is used to manage the index.). Choose stocks like PowerGrid, NTPC, etc., which are relatively steady.)</p>
<p><strong>METHOD 2: STOCKS IN THE NEWS</strong></p>
<p>Once a FNO stock gets in the news, for the right or wrong reasons, you see massive volatility. Latch on to it on the first day the news breaks. Examples: Fortis, PC Jewellers, HCC, RNaval, Wockhardt.</p>
<p><strong>METHOD 3: RESULTS DATE</strong></p>
<p>FNO stocks react sharply on results day. Though the results season is over now, there will be many more to come.</p>
<p>This is how you discover volatile and steady stocks to apply options strategies to.</p>
<p>Do not start option trading unless you perfect the techniques using paper trades.</p>

This is if you are going long.</p>
<p>You also can short, but please work with strict stop losses and be quick with your trades. Try ad book out intra day.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If your idea is to use this strategy for intra day trading, it will NOT work.</strong></span></p>
<p>So be ready for that.</p>
<p><strong>ESSENTIAL READING FOR WANNABE SWING TRADERS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Before swing trading, you will have to learn how to analyze open interest data. <a href="https://bullbull.in/market-iq/how-to-analyze-open-interest-data-and-generate-profitable-swing-trades/"><strong>Here is a guide that will help</strong></a>.</li>
<li>You also will have to learn how the MACD works. <a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/how-to-use-the-macd-indicator-for-spotting-momentum-and-trend/"><strong>Here is a MACD indicator guide</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Finally, I urge you to glance through a trading setup that can help you generate profits. <a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/a-live-trade-setup-that-can-generate-super-profits/"><strong>Here is the post</strong></a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please read and absorb all the materials before going any further.</p>
<p><strong>UNDERSTANDING CHART TIME FRAMES USED FOR SWING TRADING</strong></p>
<p>A swing trader typically checks 3 time frames:</p>
<ol>
<li>ONE WEEK for understanding overall trend <em>(time period to check &#8211; 4-5 months)</em></li>
<li>ONE DAY for understanding short term trendsÂ <em>(time period to check &#8211; 5-6 weeks)</em></li>
<li>ONE HOUR for entering into tradesÂ <em>(time period to check &#8211; 3-4 weeks)</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>SUGGESTED TECHNICAL INDICATORS</strong></p>
<p>I use the following indicators:</p>
<p><strong>a. Ichimoku Cloud</strong></p>
<p><strong>b. Supertrend</strong></p>
<p><strong>c. MACD</strong></p>
<p>You can set up these on the charts at Investing.com or elsewhere, or you can work with any indicators that you are comfortable with. There are no hard and fast rules.</p>
<p>The suggested indicators have been discussed in the reading material prescribed above.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT&#8217;S THE RIGHT TIME TO START FIGURING OUT POTENTIAL STOCKS?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m assuming you have read the articles posted above. Without reading or understanding those, you will not be able to figure out how to identify stocks that make for good swing trades.</p>
<p><strong>In Choppy Markets</strong>: About 12.30 PM to 1 PM is a good enough time because trends take time to stabilize</p>
<p><strong>In Trending Markets</strong>: You can start as early as 10.30 AM to 11 AM</p>
<p>You also MUST check EOD Open Interest Data which gives you a clearer and better picture.</p>
<p>Last evening I came across heavy OI + Volumes buildup in Godrej Consumer Products and tweeted about it:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Track Godrej Consumer Products tomorrow on the charts.. it is likely that it will break resistance if markets are steady or up. The chart is #3 out of 4 charts. <a href="https://t.co/OuIliLiEjp">pic.twitter.com/OuIliLiEjp</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Sunil Tinani (@TheBullBull) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBullBull/status/999310115969949697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>At EOD yesterday the CMP was 1101.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it makes for a good swing trade because of high OI buildup.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s check the OI now at 1.30 PM on 24-5-18</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/swing-trade2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2428" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/swing-trade2.jpg" alt="how to use OI data in swing trading" width="803" height="56" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/swing-trade2.jpg 803w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/swing-trade2-300x21.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/swing-trade2-768x54.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></a></p>
<p>The price is up 0.34%, OI is the same as yesterday, and volumes have yet to pick up.</p>
<p>However, it is 1.30 PM now and we still have 2 hours to go. Moreover, the price has appreciated from 1101 to 1108. Therefore Godrej Consumer Products is a conviction pick for a swing trade.</p>

<h2>ALL THREE CHARTS CONFIRM THAT GODREJ CONSUMER PRODUCTS IS IN A BULL ZONE. BASED ON OI DATA IT MAKES A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR A SWING TRADE WITH THE SL AT 1090 (the Ichimoku and SuperTrend supports).</h2>
<p>Put this guide into practice. Enter into a few paper trades, convince yourself abut the efficiency of this strategy, and only then enter into a trade.</p>

<p>Stock Exchanges measure Open Interest (OI) as a number that represents outstanding (open) Futures and Options (FNO) contracts.</p>
<p>Outstanding contracts of any stock or index as measured as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Outstanding Contracts in futures trades<br />
(+)<br />
Outstanding Contracts in Call Options at different Strike Rates<br />
(+)<br />
Outstanding Contracts in Call Options at different Strike Rates<br />
=<br />
TOTAL OPEN INTEREST IN THAT STOCK (OR INDEX).</strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<h3>The OI is calculated for one side (Long or Short)</h3>
<h3><strong>A. Example of How Outstanding Open Interest is Measured</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2281" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI-1.jpg" alt="how to calculate open interest" width="1082" height="273" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI-1.jpg 1082w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI-1-300x76.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI-1-768x194.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI-1-1024x258.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1082px) 100vw, 1082px" /></a></p>
<p>Note that when you take the <strong>net position</strong>, it is always <strong>ZERO</strong> because for every buyer there is a seller. But OI is calculated as the number contracts outstanding on either side.</p>
<p>Buyers and sellers keep squaring up their positions before expiry and therefore the open interest keeps on fluctuating (rising or falling) every day.</p>
<p><strong>B. OPEN INTEREST PERMUTATIONS (and their interpretation)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2283" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI2.jpg" alt="how to analyze open interest data" width="570" height="146" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI2.jpg 570w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI2-300x77.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how you analyze the different permutations:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>OI RISING, PRICE RISING, VOLUME RISING</strong><br />
Buyers are chasing the stock making the price rise. The OI too is building up and the volumes too are increasing.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>THIS IS A BULLISH SIGNAL</strong></span></span></li>
<li><strong>OI RISING, PRICE FALLING, VOLUME RISING<br />
</strong>Sellers are hammering the stock, making the price fall. The OI is building up and the volumes too are increasing (both indicating an increase in shorts).<br />
<strong><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">THIS IS A BEARISH SIGNAL</span></strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>OI FALLING, PRICE NEUTRAL OR FALLING, VOLUMES FALLING<br />
</strong>It implies that bulls are squaring up positions leading to a fall in prices. However, volumes too are dropping and therefore the downside can be limited.<br />
<span style="color: #ff6600;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>THIS IS A SIGNAL TO TRACK THE STOCK because once the selling is done, it can move either way, with a higher chance of it moving up.</strong></span></span></li>
<li><strong>OI FALLING, PRICE RISING, VOLUMES FALLING<br />
</strong>It implies that bears are covering shorts leading to a rise in prices. However, volumes too are dropping and therefore the upside can be limited.<br />
<span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>THIS IS A SIGNAL TO TRACK THE STOCK because once the short covering is done, it can move either way, with a higher chance of it moving down.</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p>Restrict your trading to these signals, and preferably, stock to 1 and 2.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOW REMEMBER, Do NOT act on OI Data without checking a special technical setup that I have crafted for you. This will follow after a few sections.</span></h3>
<h3><strong>C. Where to Access Live Open Interest Data</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/stocks/marketstats/open-interest/sector/futures-automotive-near.html">MoneyControl is the best source where you can check OI data per sector</a>. Remember to browse stocks in each sector. This link will take you to the auto sector and from there on you can use the drop down.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nseindia.com/products/content/equities/equities/oi_spurts.htm">The second source is the NSE website which does provide helpful information but does not report increases in price and volumes</a>,Â  (which you will have to manually verify). Still it&#8217;s a good tool.</p>
<h3><strong>D. What Time To Access OI Data</strong></h3>
<p>The data gets more and more meaningful as the trading day passes by, and you should ideally start checking data from around 12 PM and check it every 15-30 minutes <span style="text-decoration: underline;">right till the end of the trading day</span>.</p>
<p><strong>You are looking for:Â </strong></p>
<p>A decent rise in OI (above say 8%-10%) with rise in volumes and an okay rise in price (you don&#8217;t want to chase stocks that have risen like crazy, so look for 2%-4%Â increase in price)<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>A decent rise in OI (above say 8%-10%) with rise in volumes and an okay fall in price (you don&#8217;t want to short stocks that have fallen like crazy, so look for 2%-4%Â drop in price)<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>REMEMBER:</strong> You will get no more than 1-3 bullish or bearish stocks everyday. These stocks are good for <strong>swing trades</strong> (trades that can stretch from 1 day to 4-5 weeks).</p>
<h3><strong>E. What to do after identifying the stocks that are eligible for swing trading</strong></h3>
<p>Even though the OI data suggests a buy or a sell, you must check what the indicators tell you.</p>
<p>Therefore, set up 3 indicators in your charting software or at Investing.com.</p>
<p><strong>a. SuperTrend<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>b. VWAP</strong><br />
(<a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/a-live-trade-setup-that-can-generate-super-profits/">you can read more about the first two indicators here</a>)<br />
<strong><br />
c. Accumulation/Distribution: </strong>This is an important indicator because it tells you whether the stock is being accumulated (bought) or distributed (sold).</p>
<p>It has a zero line. When the indicator is below the zero line, it means distribution is taking place, and when it is above the zero line, it implies investors are buying.</p>
<p>Now when when the Accumulation-Distribution line reverses its trend, you must track the stock.</p>
<p>For example, if a stock is lagging and the accumulation-distribution line starts moving up towards or crosses the zero line, it means strong hands are buying the stock irrespective of how the price moves. And vice versa.</p>
<p>This is an extremely important indicator that you must set for any stock that you identify.</p>
<p>So, on Sunday night when I started writing this article, I found that PTC was generating a lot of interest and the OI data looked bullish.</p>
<p>But I did not act. Instead I checked the charts (The 1D candles because the stock was to be bought for a swing trade) and found that:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI3-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2289" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI3-1.jpg" alt="OI data technicals accumulation distribution" width="1349" height="665" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI3-1.jpg 1349w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI3-1-300x148.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI3-1-768x379.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI3-1-1024x505.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1349px) 100vw, 1349px" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I saw and concluded:</p>
<ol>
<li>Candles were red right from the opening.</li>
<li>SuperTrend signaled a sell when the price was 95.</li>
<li>The stock was way below its VWAP.</li>
<li>Though the stock was in an accumulation phase (above zero line), the line was falling.</li>
</ol>
<p>All these factors made me stay away from the stock. But you should keep on watching the PTC charts for signs of reversal. And if the accumulation line starts getting stronger, you should then check the OI and consider it for a swing trade.</p>
<p>And this is exactly what you should do once you identify stock.</p>
<h3><strong>F. Analyzing Open Interest Data</strong></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s 14-5-18 and around 3.20 PM.</p>
<p>To write a live article I would start watching OI data from 12 PM. However, I have gotten late and at 3.20 PM, here are a couple of stocks that look good for a swing trade:</p>
<p><strong>Canara Bank:</strong> 13% increase in OI, 103% increase in volume and 1% increase in price. This should be on your watchlist.</p>
<p>It is is accumulation zone and is the accumulation line is steady. <strong>Any spike in price can be a sign of bullishness</strong>. I would watch Canara Bank.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2291" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI4.jpg" alt="OI data analysis on technical charts" width="1366" height="699" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI4.jpg 1366w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI4-300x154.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI4-768x393.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI4-1024x524.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Adani Ports</strong>: 19.6% increase in OI, 124% increase in volumes and 1.21% fall in price. Given Adani&#8217;s political connections and the sword of elections dangling over India, it does seem that the stock will now be volatile.</p>
<p>Though positive, the accumulation distribution line has started falling. I would watch this stock and if the accumulation-distribution line starts dropping, Adani Ports could be a shorting candidate.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2292" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI5.jpg" alt="interpret open interest data" width="1349" height="636" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI5.jpg 1349w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI5-300x141.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI5-768x362.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/OI5-1024x483.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1349px) 100vw, 1349px" /></a></p>
<p>So, well, this is how you interpret OI data, apply technicals to your picks and then act. Of course, I did an EOD study today, but would urge you folks to start checking OI data from 12 PM onwards to figure out a couple of profitable swing trades. Good luck.</p>
