		<description><![CDATA[I think that the best strategy is buying puts when the relative volatility is low and the price of the option is inexpensive.  With a diverse portfolio of good quality dividend stocks that I can stand a 20% decline before protection kicks in;  I prefer to buy January puts if the cost for a given delta is cheaper than buying monthly puts and rolling every month.  Also a January put gives you the option of selling the put in December for tax planning.  Out of money puts provide wedge protection in that the lower the price of the stock goes the better the protection becomes on a non linier basis.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Instead of watching the premium, catch the trend. For example when the IT sector started trending puts were available at paise for very low strike prices. These did not make any sense in an options premium calculator. But when the fall started, the premiums gave a 500%-1000% return. 

In any case, I buy puts to hedge my PF, not to trade. Once bought, I don&#039;t care about the rates because I would rather have that insurance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sir, please bear with my query. As mentioned in above blog post, on 23 Oct Nifty closed at 10184. I couldn&#039;t figure out why you bought put options for 9500 strike instead of ATM 10200 Strike option. I went through your tool. But couldn&#039;t select the right strike. Looking forward for your valuable guidance to protect/insure  my portfolio of midcap stocks.]]></description>
