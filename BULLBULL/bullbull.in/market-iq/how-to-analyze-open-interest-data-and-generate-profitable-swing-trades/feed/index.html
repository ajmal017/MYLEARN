		<description><![CDATA[Adani is a political stock and the promoters keep buying it from the open market and keep pledging it. I suggest that you avoid news based stocks because the charts can generate a lot of false positives or negatives.

For Swing trades you should look at live data starting from 11 AM and checking every 15 minutes. Data points to monitor would be high OI buildup in excess of 7-8% and a reasonable rally in price by 1-2% because you you don&#039;t want to jump into stocks that have appreciated more than 5-10%]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the interesting post Sunil ji. Appreciate the same. I have following queries on Accumulation/ Distribution as below:

1. In case of Adani chart in your post, during the month the A-D has exhibited a downward slope multiple times and then this slope got reversed. So if all other indicators suggest a trend and the A-D starts sloping downwards, should v take an action or will it be safer to wait and take action when A-D line is closer to &quot;Zero&quot; line and seems ready to go on the other side ?

2. For swing trades and for someone who can only give time to look at EOD data, what data points should we monitor ?

Thank you for your kind help.

regards

Sourabh]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Sunil, I am holding India Cements &#038; Coal India May Futures. I have analyzed based on your OI article and my comments are below;

India Cements

As per 18 May closing, India Cements price down by 3%, OI up by 0.17% and volumes up by 13%. The Supertrend for both 1 and 3 month is negative, which is price is 5% to 8% lower than the supertrend values for 1 and 3 months. The closing price is also below the VWAP on a 1 month chart / 1 hour candle. ADX: -DI is going significantly over +DI on 1 month timeframe and hourly candle with ADX value of 17. What is the inference, is it very bearish

Coal India

As per 18 May closing, Coal India price down by 2%, OI down by 2% and volumes down by 48%. 1 month Supertrend is below 18 May closing price and 3 month supertrend is above closing price. The closing price is also below the 1 month VWAP. ADX: -DI is going over +DI on 1 month timeframe and hourly candle with ADX value of 22. What is the inference, is it very bearish, or since as per OI since price, volumes and OI’s are falling, there will be a turnaround and bounce back of prices

Your suggestions and analysis will be very much appreciated]]></description>
