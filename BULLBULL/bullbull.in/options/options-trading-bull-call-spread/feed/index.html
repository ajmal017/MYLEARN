		<description><![CDATA[Sir,
Thanks for sharing this. Was looking to learn options. However I did not understand losing Rs.25 . Could you please explain a bit more? What is did not move as per expectations mean? Can you quote a number here where it moved? Would help

you will end up losing Rs 25 per unit (135 – 110) X 75 = 1,875]]></description>
