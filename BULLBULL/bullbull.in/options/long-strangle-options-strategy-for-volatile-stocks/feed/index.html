		<description><![CDATA[Hello Sir,
Thanks for sharing, Currently Backtesting it and just wanted to know on a result day don&#039;t you think options are costly due to IV and we should use short strangle?
Also choosing 250 CE and 200 PE is just simple logic that stock can not move beyond this range or something else.

Thanks a lot in advance for your revert back.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi boss its your follower from twitter
https://twitter.com/Kanemasters

Excellent post.
But I wanted to resolve a doubt about the Maximum loss in this strategy.
You mentioned that 
&quot;Worst Case Scenario

The worst case scenario in this case would have been P C Jewellers staying steady or moving 5 bucks either way during the day.

If it were steady, you would have lost the options brokerage, which would have been a 100 bucks here or there.

In the worst possible case (inconsistently steady movement) you would have max lost a buck either way and your losses would have been capped to Rs 3,000 (worst case).&quot;

But will that not happen, only if we keep our SL at 1Rs downside for both options.

Otherwise it will be like this in case of Max Loss
Max Loss

The maximum loss is limited. The maximum loss occurs if the underlying stock remains between the strike prices until expiration. If at expiration the stock&#039;s price is between the strikes, both options will expire worthless and the entire premium paid will have been lost.
SO in this scenario it will be
1500 X 12 = 18,000
+
1500 X 16 = 24,000
Total = RS 48,000 + Brokerage as per your broker]]></description>
