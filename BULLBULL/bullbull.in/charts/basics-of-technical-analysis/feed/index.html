		<description><![CDATA[Sir,
In my approach to technical analysis I give more importance to accumulation and distribution rather than price action. I feel that when accumulation happens and its level rises to new highs market is getting accumulated by strong hands from weak hands and results in a supply shortage of stocks and this will eventually lead to price action as comparatively weak hands will chase the stocks  and till fundamentals support this price action and valuation, it will continue.So i believe that accumulation/distribution lines give a good combination of  both technical analysis and fundamentals. Sir,Please have a look at the detailed notes on my approach, which i have posted on valuepikr on march 3rd. I couldn&#039;t paste my charts in the comment column. thats why I pasted the link to the post.
