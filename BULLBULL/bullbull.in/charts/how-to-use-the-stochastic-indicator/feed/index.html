		<description><![CDATA[Hello Sunil,
Thanks for your insights on Stochastic Indicator.
I was doing the same analysis on &quot;Bodal Chemicals&quot; over a 1day chart. And by the chart, the setup was like this:
1. Stochastic was around 75 levels
2. 200 MA was above 50 MA and the candles were above the 50 MA but below 200.

In this Case, What&#039;s your view and also how significant it becomes when a higher MA crosses a lower MA?]]></description>
