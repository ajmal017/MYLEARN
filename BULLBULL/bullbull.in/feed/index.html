<p>Sector stock analysis helps investors learn about the type of stocks that operators and other biggies are accumulating. The accumulation by the biggies can be anything &#8211; better financial condition for the companies going ahead (long term prospects) or for the for a quick short term trade.</p>
<p>Whatever reason it may be, sectoral analysis helps investors judge how well stocks in the different sectors will perform in the near-long term.</p>
<p>The analysis would be even sharper and trades more profitable if the data was available live, and based on micro sectors.</p>
<p>Well, you&#8217;re in luck, because there is a website that breaks down sectors into micro sectors and helps in your quest.</p>
<p>For example, if the two wheeler segment in the auto sector is trending up, it helps you latch on to two wheeler stocks, and so on.</p>
<p>Before I discuss this website, know that many folks who analyze sectors often refer to sites that give the macro picture.</p>
<p>For example, what use is information that the auto sector is trending up when the sector is up because only 2 wheelers are in an uptrend?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you will agree that analyzing micro sectoral data than analyzing the macro data.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.bseindia.com/markets/Equity/EQReports/industrywatchList.aspx">There is only one website that displays this helpful information &#8211; and it is the BSE.</a></h2>
<p>You also can drill down into any micro sector and figure out the stocks that are performing and separate these from the duds.</p>
<h3>Best of all, it allows analyze information of 111 micro sectors spread over 4 pages!</h3>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>This is how you figure out trending sectors. The next steps would be:</p>
<ol>

<li><a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/a-live-trade-setup-that-can-generate-super-profits/">Check their technicals using our setup</a>, or any setup you are comfortable with.</li>

<li>Keep checking every 15 minutes in the live market and at EOD and make a list of stocks that look bullish or bearish (do not forget to check sectors that are trending down so that you can hedge your long bets).</li>
<li>Paper trade and check this strategy out for at least a week before you are convinced of its usefulness.</li>

<p>The best thing about this setup is that you can have a long list of stocks and apply your favorite technicals to each stock with the click of a mouse.</p>
<h2>STEP 1: DISCOVER STOCKS BY ANALYZING OI DATA</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/market-iq/how-to-analyze-open-interest-data-and-generate-profitable-swing-trades/">You&#8217;ll need to learn how to do this and here&#8217;s an article on the subject.</a></strong></p>
<p>Make a list of stocks that look interesting based on Open Interest data. I compiled a sample list based on OI data of 8/6/18 EOD, and am assuming that you know by now how to analyze OI data.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/high-OI-stocks.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2668" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/high-OI-stocks.jpg" alt="how to analyze NSE OI data" width="976" height="864" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/high-OI-stocks.jpg 976w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/high-OI-stocks-300x266.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/high-OI-stocks-768x680.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px" /></a></p>
<p>So, a list of bullish stocks (I&#8217;ve taken about 9+% OI along with a rise in price and volume to be high-probability bullish) across three sectors are:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>IGL, GAIL, Reliance, Indian Bank, Bajaj Finance, Star (Strides Shasun), Wockhardt Pharma.</strong></span></p>
<p>So we now have a sample list of stocks that could do well on Monday. These are the stocks that we must watch on Monday morning and take a chance based on their charts.</p>
<p>Note that this is just a sample list and you probably can figure out more stocks after analyzing all the sectors.</p>
<p>Now remember this: OI keeps changing and therefore you must have it open while you trade. You also must check how it keeps changing and bring new stocks (bullish or bearish) under your radar.</p>
<p>Typically you can start checking OI data from 10 AM onwards and check every 15 minutes or so for changes.</p>
<p>Right, now let&#8217;s check the Options Chain of any one of the shortlisted stocks.</p>
<h2>STEP 2: ANALYZE THE OPTIONS CHAIN DATA</h2>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/options/how-to-analyze-call-and-put-writing-and-predict-trends/"><strong>You will need to learn how to analyze Call and Put Writing signals and this article will help.</strong></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve analyzed the Star (Strides Shasun) options chain and here&#8217;s what it looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/options-OI.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2671" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/options-OI.jpg" alt="options for intra day trades" width="1017" height="509" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/options-OI.jpg 1017w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/options-OI-300x150.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/options-OI-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1017px) 100vw, 1017px" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my analysis:</p>
<p>The stock is at 357.</p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> Call writers are squaring up their positions at 360CE 28 June 2018. You can see OI for that CE is down by 10,200. This implies that the writers are afraid to short the 360CE <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and therefore the chances of the stock moving higher look bright</strong></span>.</p>
<p><strong>(b) </strong>Call writers are happy about selling 380CE, 400CE and higher CEs for the same expiry implying that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they don&#8217;t see the stock moving beyond 380-400 up to 28 June</strong></span>.</p>
<p><strong>(c) </strong>Put writers are unafraid of writing 360 and below PEs, and you can also see that most Put buyers have lost money (while most CE buyers have made money). This implies that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the writers don&#8217;t see the stock falling much from current levels up to 28 June</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, Star or Strides Shasun looks like a bullish trade in the short term (BTST to 4-5 days). Of course, with a strict stop loss.</p>
<p>Now, we have a probable trades for Monday and so set up the charts.</p>
<h2>STEP 3: SET UP THE CHARTS</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s make a list of all the stocks mentioned above to check on the charts on Monday.</p>
<p>Open <strong><a href="https://in.investing.com/">Investing.com</a></strong>, and sign in to your free account.</p>
<p>Hover the mouse over your Name in the member bar at the top and choose &#8220;Portfolio&#8221; from the drop down.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Investing.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2674" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Investing.jpg" alt="how to setup for a day trade" width="847" height="358" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Investing.jpg 847w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Investing-300x127.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Investing-768x325.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p>
<p>Once you are in the portfolio section, enter the stocks you have selected.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/investing-portfolio-charts.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2675" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/investing-portfolio-charts.jpg" alt="how to set up portfolio on charts" width="986" height="541" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/investing-portfolio-charts.jpg 986w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/investing-portfolio-charts-300x165.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/investing-portfolio-charts-768x421.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/investing-portfolio-charts-120x67.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px" /></a></p>
<p>Now click on any one symbol. I&#8217;m clicking on Strides Shasun as it is used as an an example in this post.</p>
<p>Now click on the &#8220;Charts&#8221; tab and it will open the chart for the first stock inn the list.</p>
<p>Expand the chart to full screen mode.</p>
<p>Apply the indicators suggested in our trade setup (Ichimoku, Supertrend, 20-50 0r 13-48 EMA, MACD).</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/a-live-trade-setup-that-can-generate-super-profits/">Also read up our trade setup to understand how a combination of this indicators work</a></strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trade-setup-multiple-stocks.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2676" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trade-setup-multiple-stocks.jpg" alt="day trading setup" width="986" height="481" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trade-setup-multiple-stocks.jpg 986w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trade-setup-multiple-stocks-300x146.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trade-setup-multiple-stocks-768x375.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px" /></a></p>
<p>Notice that all the stocks that you have added in the portfolio get featured on the right.</p>
<p>You can add as many stocks as you like and keep deleting stocks that no longer interest you.</p>
<h2>STEP 4: ANALYZE THE CHARTS</h2>
<p>As an example I&#8217;ve analyzed Strides Shasun 1-Hour chart as this period is ideal for a swing trade analysis.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strides-chart.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2677" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strides-chart.jpg" alt="how to analyze 1 hour charts" width="1358" height="661" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strides-chart.jpg 1358w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strides-chart-300x146.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strides-chart-768x374.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/strides-chart-1024x498.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1358px) 100vw, 1358px" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;re my observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Supertrend indicated a buy at 358 and the stock hit 370+ before reacting back to 357. In any case, SuperTrend gives good entries but is late on exits.</li>
<li>The 20 EMA is still below 50 EMA and this is not a bullish sign.</li>
<li>The price is below the Ichimoku cloud, base lines and the EMAs. This data implies that the stock is in a downtrend.</li>
<li>The 1-Day and 1-Week charts too suggest that the stock is in a bear grip.</li>
<li>The MACD line is drooping as well. Not a good sign.</li>
<li>The Options Chain, on the other hand, indicates bullishness and the possibility of the stock hitting between 360-380 in the short run.</li>
<li>The OI data too is bullish.</li>
<li><strong>The charts are contrasting with the Options and OI data</strong>. Typically, the action starts in the derivatives before hitting the cash market.</li>
<li>So, while it makes sense watching Strides Shashun on the charts, it also makes sense to try a long strangle in the options by buying  PE and CE at ITM (In The Money) prices. This is because Strides Shasun looks very volatile give the divergent views of the derivatives and the charts data. <a href="https://bullbull.in/options/long-strangle-options-strategy-for-volatile-stocks/">This post helps you understand what a long strangle is</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>STEP 5: USING THIS SETUP</h2>
<ol>
<li>Revise the setup at the end of day, before every trading day.</li>
<li>Be ready with list of stocks at 9.15 AM and by then you should know the stocks with the highest potential to move either way.</li>
<li>Start checking the OI and Options Chain data every 15 minutes starting from 10.30 AM for OI and 10 AM for the Options data.</li>
<li>Keep adding or deleting stocks to the Investing.com portfolio per your analyses.</li>
<li>Keep analysing charts by switching between stocks. Additionally you can set up alerts per stock so that you know when stock prices touch your target.</li>
<li>Repeat.Perform a few paper trades to get a hang of this style. Good luck.</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#8217;ve taken a jewelry company as a case study because it will help you catch the areas that need to be focused on.</p>
<p>However, this article is not just about that company  &#8211; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the goal of this post is to inform you that it is COMPULSORY to read the Annual Report (AR) before buying a stock.</strong></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve correlated different finance heads and applied common sense, because it is all boils down to common sense and a very basic understanding of business.</p>
<p>Here are some areas that seemed glaringly out of the place:</p>
<h2>SHORT TERM LIQUIDITY</h2>
<p>Any company must have the capacity to meet short-term obligations.</p>
<p>If the company does not have enough liquid assets to pay short term liabilities, it shows inefficient cash management.</p>
<p>(Cash + Investments + Debtors)  which are liquid assets, must exceed Current Liabilities (trade payables, short term borrowings and other current liabilities that are payable)</p>
<p>Inventories do not count because selling these will seriously impair its business.</p>
<p>Also, if at all it has to sell inventory then it will take time and huge losses because no one will buy stock in trade at market rates.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s take a look at this company&#8217;s short term liquidity:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/QR.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2645 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/QR.jpg" alt="quick ratio explained with examples" width="616" height="542" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/QR.jpg 616w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/QR-300x264.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Investments + Debtors + Cash/Bank + Other Liquid assets = </b><b>2511 </b><b>crores</b></p>
<p><b>Short term borrowing + Creditors + other short term liabilities = </b><b>3785 </b><b>crores</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>So if there’s a run on this company, it would have been </b><b>short 1274 </b></span><b><span style="color: #ff0000;">crores</span>.</b></p>
<p>There are comments below that gold could be sold to meet the shortfall. But if the company starts selling its gold, it won&#8217;t get the market price and would incur a loss. Moreover it would jeopardize their business and the brand name.</p>
<h2>INTEREST ON BORROWINGS</h2>
<p>Typically a company obtains long term loans to invest in capital assets and short term loans to finance the working capital.</p>
<p>The interest on long term loans is lower than the interest on short term loans. Given the present day interest regime (mid 2018), the rate of interest would work up to a maximum of about 13%.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s now check how much this company has paid:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings3.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2649 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings3.jpg" alt="interest analysis" width="596" height="290" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings3.jpg 596w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings3-300x146.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /></a></p>
<p>It has paid 274 crores on account of interest. Now let&#8217;s check its loans:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2648" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings.jpg" alt="pc jewellers borrowings loans" width="596" height="290" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings.jpg 596w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/borrowings-300x146.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /></a></p>
<p>It has obtained loans of Rs 634 crores.</p>
<p><b>Interest Paid for the year = </b><b>275 </b><b>crores on loan of 634 crores. </b></p>
<p><u><b>Works out to a 43.35% rate of interest. Looks abnormal.</b></u></p>
<p>There were tweets that the company takes gold on lease instead of buying stock. And then someone tweeted that jewelry company take gold leases and therefore let&#8217;s explore that angle as well:</p>
<p>So let us work out how much the company took gold on lease.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/revival-of-gold-on-lease-to-benefit-titan-pc-jewellers-more-115021900888_1.html">Many companies take gold on lease from banks and the rate of interest is about 5% to 8%</a>.</p>
<p>Standalone sales are 8105 crores. Exports make up 34%.</p>
<p>Cost of goods sold is 7400 crores. It is not specified in this account head how much represents making charges, and how much are purchases of gold.</p>
<p>Now, making is a value add activity and it should result in a higher profit margin. But if you correlate the cost of goods sold to the sales, we get a margin of 9% on standalone basis. Therefore, it can be safe to assume that the the cost of goods sold includes purchases of gold and diamonds.</p>
<p>Now, in a gold lease, the bank leases gold to the jewelry maker and in turn the jewelry maker has to secure the bank with some collateral that covers the cost of the gold.</p>
<p>Now let us assume that this company took gold on lease and it was shown in the inventory (asset).</p>
<p>Will it not be safe to assume that the bank demanded a collateral and the company created some charge on FDs or some other assets?</p>
<p>It will be safe to make this assumption.  Let&#8217;s look at the companies assets (standalone) (no major divergences in consolidated figures).</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pcj007.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2658 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pcj007.jpg" alt="assets analysis" width="929" height="602" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pcj007.jpg 929w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pcj007-300x194.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pcj007-768x498.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px" /></a></p>
<p>Which asset could have been pledged against the gold leases?</p>
<p>The investments represent investment in a subsidiary &#8211; THIS CANNOT BE PLEDGED</p>
<p>The loans represent loans to related parties &#8211; THESE CANNOT BE PLEDGED</p>
<p>Deferred assets, trade receivables, loans CANNOT BE PLEDGED.</p>
<p>Other assets represent mostly prepaid expenses &#8211; CANNOT BE PLEDGED</p>
<p>Inventories are assumed to have been taken on lease &#8211; CANNOT BE PLEDGED</p>
<p>Cash is required for the business &#8211; CANNOT BE PLEDGED</p>
<p>Bank Balance is 555 crores and is represented by deposits below 3 months. This CAN BE PLEDGED.</p>
<p>Therefore I am assuming that 555 crores or thereabouts is the value of the gold leases and assuming the highest rate of interest @ 8%, which is 44 crores.</p>
<p>THEREFORE THE TOTAL INTEREST PAID CAN BE ABOUT 10% ON 634 CRORE (LOANS) <strong>plus </strong>THE ASSUMED INTEREST ON GOLD LEASES OF 44 CRORES.</p>
<p>Note that though gold leases are for a short period, I am assuming the company kept rolling over gold leases and obtained 555 crores for 1 year and paid the highest rate of interest.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Therefore the total interest that I can assume is about Rs 107 crores while the interest provided is Rs 274 crores. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Even if you assume 1% LC charges on exports booked as interest, we can add another 27 crores to the interest taking it to 134 crores, while the interest paid is 274 crores. </strong></span></p>
<p><b>INFERENCE: OBVIOUSLY THERE IS SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT ADD UP.</b></p>
<h2>INVENTORY LEVELS</h2>
<p>Sales for the YE 31.3.17 are 8104 crores</p>
<p>The cost of sales is 7409 crores, which implies that this company makes about 9% gross profit margin.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2650" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory.jpg" alt="what is inventory ratio" width="611" height="317" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory.jpg 611w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory-300x156.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" /></a></p>
<p>Inventory as on 31-3-17 is 4119 crores. Let us add 9% and reconcile it with the selling rate. We get inventory at 4526 crores at market prices.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2651 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory-2.jpg" alt="why is inventory to turnover ratio important" width="611" height="228" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory-2.jpg 611w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sales-inventory-2-300x112.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" /></a></p>
<p>Every company holds inventory in the hope of selling it quickly and turning around the cash with which it can do more business.</p>
<p>Heavy inventories are a sign of inefficient inventory management.</p>
<p>In the case of this company, the inventory held represents 6.5 months of sale. This is an extraordinarily high level of inventory and a sign that inventory management needs to sharpen up .</p>
<p><b>Remember that high value inventory like jewelry and diamonds are surrounded by negative factors such as high storage costs,  fear of theft, interest to pay, etc.</b></p>
<p>Clearly, the 6.5 months of inventory seems high.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>There is a comment below that you need this kind of inventory in the jewelry business.</strong> </span></p>
<p>Let us take the case of <strong>Titan</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Sales 12717 crores</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inventory 4807 crores</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s 4.5 months of inventory for 640+ jewelry and Fasttrack stores. The company in this example has 75 stores and remember, 34% of its products are exported.  <strong>Titan</strong> too exports but I don&#8217;t have the percentage at this moment.</p>
<p>In any case, I do feel that in the Jewelry business an inventory of 4.5 to 5 months is acceptable. Anything over that suggests that operations must be optimized.</p>
<h2>MARKET CAPITALIZATION TO TOTAL LIABILITIES</h2>
<p>Actually, this  check wouldn&#8217;t have applied last year when the this company&#8217;s AR was released and its its stock price was very high that time.</p>
<p>However, you should apply it to all companies in the news for the wrong reasons to get a understanding of what would happen to them if there&#8217;s a run on their finances.</p>
<p><b>The current market cap of this company = 2450 </b><b>crores</b><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>Total  Liabilities = 3850 </b><b>crores</b><b><br />
(excl </b><b>equity</b><b> cap + reserves)</b></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mcap.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2654" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mcap.jpg" alt="mcap to total liabilities" width="592" height="317" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mcap.jpg 592w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mcap-300x161.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /></a></p>
<p><b>INFERENCE: There&#8217;s a shortfall of 1400 crores, which means that the confidence of investors in this company&#8217;s assets is not high. This correlation shows how much the company&#8217;s assets can possibly decline in value in case there&#8217;s a run on it.</b></p>
<h2>CASH FLOW</h2>
<p>By now you would have realized that this company was holding very high inventory levels, paying a high rate of interest and its short term liquidity was not good.</p>
<p>What should this company do in such circumstances?</p>
<p>Use cash for optimizing operations, wiping off debt, etc.</p>
<p>Therefore let&#8217;s check the company&#8217;s cash flow statement.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cash-flow.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2655 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cash-flow.jpg" alt="cash flow" width="610" height="526" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cash-flow.jpg 610w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cash-flow-300x259.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></a></p>
<p><b>The company has invested in a subsidiary and handed over a loan to a group company, both transactions amounting to 293 </b><b>crores, and it ended up taking a new loan (net) of </b><b> </b><b>1</b><b>80 </b><b>crores to fund the transactions.</b></p>
<p><b>INFERENCE: Cash management does not meet accepted norms.</b></p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>Would you have invested in this company last year when it was peaking even after analyzing this information?</p>
<p>Of course, you wouldn&#8217;t have.</p>
<h2>So, this post is not to take you into the past and give you lectures about any company. The objective of this post is to make you understand that it is extremely important to read and analyze Annual Reports before making an investment.</h2>

<p>Priti International makes small ticket home furnishing items and accessories, some furniture, pet comfort products, bags, and other personal goods. From the website it seems that it wants to expand into other home items, specially in furniture.</p>
<p>It is a decent line of business. Majority of the products are exported and the competition comes from the unorganized export sector and of course, from China.</p>
<p>At first glance, the company does radiate a decent perception, even though the moat is of average strength.</p>
<p><strong>PAST</strong></p>
<p>The company is new in the sense it has purchased the sole proprietorship company of the promoter for a consideration of 1.54 crores. So, there&#8217;s no point in going into the financials.</p>
<p>However&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/priti-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2625" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/priti-1.jpg" alt="priti international cash flows" width="709" height="383" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/priti-1.jpg 709w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/priti-1-300x162.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 100vw, 709px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230;it is important to note that the company reported a negative operational cash flow for the period ended 31-12-17 and ended up financing its operations and investments from debt. This is because the company took over the business of the proprietor on 30 November 2017 for 1.54 crores, and that leaves a question &#8211; if the company was formed for taking over the business of the proprietor, who is now a promoter, why did it incur a cash outflow of Rs 1.96 crores from operations?</p>
<p>Now, it will be interesting to figure out how the company has priced the share at Rs 75.</p>
<p><strong>IPO PRICING</strong></p>
<p>The company justifies a price of Rs 75 a share because of</p>
<p>a. Experienced management</p>
<p>b. Global presence (but the company does not have offices overseas)</p>
<p>c. EPS of 3.47 on pre IPO capital. (this will further dilute post-IPO)</p>
<p>d. Return on Net Worth of 3.99% (Isn&#8217;t this a rather poor RoR?)</p>
<p>e. NAV of Rs 21 on 31-12-17</p>
<p>These are rather weak reasons for justifying an issue price of Rs 75.</p>
<h2>Given these factors, and despite the company exuding a good perception, I would wait and see what happens post listing before deciding to enter or avoid Priti International.</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>TIME:</strong> The time left up to the expiry.</li>
<li><strong>STRIKE PRICE</strong>: The price at which you are buying or selling the option.</li>
<li><strong>OPTION PREMIUM</strong>: The premium of the call or put option that you intend to trade in.</li>
<li><strong>UNDERLYING PRICE: </strong>The CMP of the Stock or Index (Underlying)</li>
<li><strong>VOLATILITY</strong>: The assumed/implied volatility of the stock/index (underlying) as calculated based on historical data.</li>
<li><strong>RATE OF INTEREST: </strong>The safe rate of interest.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Options Greeks correlate and analyze these sensitives and and Options Writers draw inferences from the analyses.</strong></p>
<p>Option Writers/Traders read the Greeks data (mainly Delta, Gamma and Theta) to enter or exit trades.</p>
<p><strong>Now before you read any more, know that there are two elements attached to each Greek:</strong></p>
<p><strong>a. What it is?</strong></p>
<p><strong>b. How is it calculated?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>The Greeks are calculated with online tools and therefore you should not bother about calculations at this moment. It is important that you understand the concept first, and then get to the calculation.</em></span></p>
<h2><strong>Concept of Options Greeks explained in plain English:</strong></h2>
<h3>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">DELTA</span> &#8211; CORRELATES OPTION PREMIUM WITH THE UNDERLYING PRICE</h3>
<p>When the price of the underlying moves up by Rs 1, its Call Option premium also moves up, while its Put Option premium falls.</p>
<p>Now, the inference is that:</p>
<p><strong>FOR CALL OPTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>When the underlying&#8217;s price moves up by Re 1, the Call Option premium can move up anywhere between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>Obviously it can&#8217;t move up above 1 or go down below 0 when the price of the underlying moves up by JUST 1 buck.</p>
<p>As per Options Greek covenants, the Delta for a call option is always POSITIVE, between 0 and 1 (or between 0 and 100) .</p>
<p><strong>This movement of the options premium in relation to the underlying price is referred to as the Delta (in this case for Call Options).</strong></p>
<p>So if the the delta for a call option is calculated by an online tool to be 0.50, it means that for that call, the premium will move up or down by 0.50 paise for every Re 1 movement in the underlying&#8217;s price. Some folks use a scale between 0 and 100, and therefore 0.50 and 50 represent the same Delta.</p>
<p><strong>FOR PUT OPTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>As per Options Greek covenants, the Delta for a call option is always NEGATIVE, between -1 and 0.</p>
<p>When the underlying&#8217;s price moves up by Re 1, the Put Option premium can fall anywhere between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>Obviously it can&#8217;t fall more than 1, or at best it can lie static by not moving (0), when the price of the underlying goes up by a buck.</p>
<p><strong>This movement of the Put options premium in relation to the underlying price is referred to as the Delta (in this case for Put Options).</strong></p>
<p>So if the Put option premium moves down by 0.30 for every Re 1 rise in the underlying CMP, the Delta is -0.30. Some folks use a scale between 0 and 100, and therefore -0.30 and -30 represent the same Delta.</p>
<p>AND, as explained above, the Delta can only be between -1 and 0 (or between -100 and 0) for a Put option.</p>
<p><strong>So we now know that the Delta for a Call Option is between 0 and 1, and between -1 and 0 for a Put Option.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SOME FEATURES OF DELTA</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If you buy an in-the-money call option, the Delta will approach 1 by expiry. This is obvious, because as expiry approaches the in-the-money options premium will more or less keep pace with the underlying&#8217;s price.</li>
<li>Conversely, the Delta for out-of-money call option will approach o by expiry.</li>
<li>If you buy an in-the-money put option, the Delta will approach -1 by expiry.</li>
<li>Conversely, the Delta for out-of-money put option will approach o by expiry.</li>
<li>The delta keeps changing. On a given day the Delta for a CE can fluctuate from 0.20 to 0.70 or from 0.50 to 0.10 very quickly, depending on how volatile a stock is.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>HOW DO OPTIONS TRADERS  USE DELTA</strong></h2>
<p>Options writers use Delta to measure their risk. For example, if an Options Writer sells a CE at 0.50 Delta and it suddenly spurts to 0.90 then his risk increases.</p>
<p>To Options Writers, the Delta also denotes the probability that an option will expire ITM. For example, if the Delta is 0.20, then there are 20% chances of that expiring in the money. Therefore, if you buy or sell naked options, you should use Delta to figure out your chance of making money.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/a-live-trade-setup-that-can-generate-super-profits/">At this point, you also must combine your reading of Delta with our trade setup</a></strong>. If our setup gives you a bullish signal, it could mean that the Delta is likely to increase.</p>
<h3>2. GAMMA &#8211; THE CORRELATION OF DELTA WITH THE UNDERLYING&#8217;S PRICE</h3>
<p>Gamma is the rate at which Delta changes based on every Re 1 fluctuation in the underlying&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>CEs have positive gamma (for every Re 1 rise in price the positive gamma gets added to the Delta, and vice ersa) while PEs have negative gamma(for every Re 1 rise in price the gamma gets deducted from the Delta, and vice versa).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s understand Gamma with the help of an example:</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say KPIT Tech is at 285 and its 28 JUNE 290 CE is selling for Rs 9.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume its delta is 0.2 and a gamma of 0.1 or 10 percent. (Note that the calculations are done by software, and these are just assumptions).</p>
<p>If the stock price moves up by Re 1 to 286, the delta will get adjusted from 0.20 to 0.30 (the Gamma of 0.10 gets added to the Delta for ever Re 1 buck jump in price, or deducted by 0.1 for every Re 1 fall in the price.</p>
<p>So Gamma accelerates with a Re 1 rise in price and reverses with the same speed with every Re 1 fall in price.</p>
<p>However, note that the Delta for a CE can move only between 0 and 1, and therefore if the underlying&#8217;s price keeps increasing or falling, the accretion to gamma will keep decreasing because the maximum limit that the Delta can hit is between 0 and 1. When the CE goes deep in the money, the Delta will equal 1 and the gamma will hit 0. Likewise (conversely) for PEs, where the Delta can only be between -1 and 0.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DO OPTIONS TRADERS  USE GAMMA</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If gamma is high for OTM CEs it means that the Delta and options premium will rise quickly with every Re 1 rise in the underlying. A bullish signal.</li>
<li>If gamma is high for OTM PEs it means that the Delta will rise quickly with every Re 1 rise in the underlying. A bearish signal.</li>
<li>Option writers get into action in the last week of expiry and start shorting OTM options in order to make premiums. They typically look for CEs and PEs with low Delta and low Gamma.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">THETA</span> &#8211; CORRELATES TIME-TO-EXPIRY WITH OPTIONS PREMIUMS</h3>
<p>Theta represents time decay. Options Writers love it, option buyers hate it.</p>
<p><strong>It tells you how much the premiums of calls and puts are expected to fall per day as the expiry draws near.</strong></p>
<p>In general, Theta for ATM and ITM options increases as expiry draws closer while Theta for deep OTM decreases as expiry nears.</p>
<h4><strong>Also, in general, volatile stocks have higher theta than non volatile stocks.</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>HOW DO OPTIONS TRADERS  USE THETA</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>Options writers write high theta options near expiry.</li>
<li>When you expect a stock to be medium term bullish but short term neutral, you can check the theta and trade a Long Calendar Spread. That is short a high theta option near expiry and buy the option for the next expiry if it has a high theta.</li>
<li>OTM options near expiry with low theta can make for a buy s long technicals suggest an uptrend, and vice versa.</li>
</ol>
<h3>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">VEGA</span> &#8211; CORRELATES OPTIONS PREMIUM WITH VOLATILITY</h3>
<p>Vega measures the movement in Options Premium with every 1% move in Implied Volatility (IV).</p>
<p>When Vega drops, it makes both calls and puts lose value.</p>
<p>When Vega rises, it makes both calls and puts gain value.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a tough call to trade on Vega, but for professional Options Traders it makes sense to know how changes in Implied Volatility can impact their positions. Professional traders focus on Delta, Gamma and Theta.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/options/how-to-discover-volatile-and-not-volatile-stocks-for-applying-options-strategies/">You can always use this guide to figure out volatility per stock</a></strong>.</p>
<h3>4. <u>RHO</u>&#8211; CORRELATES OPTIONS PREMIUM WITH 1% CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES</h3>
<p>All options calculators factor in a safe rate of interest, which is the interest rate generally paid on Government Treasury Bonds. Currently the safe rate is hovering between 7.7% and 7.9%.</p>
<p>Though rates are generally stable and moving 1% either way is a Herculean task, even a small change can impact premiums. We&#8217;re at 5 June 2018 and tomorrow is the day of the RBI policy. There&#8217;s a hike in interest rates expected and that could impact options premiums.</p>
<p>Generally, when interest rates are stable, Rho does not impact premiums.</p>
<p><strong>How and When Rho Impacts Options Premiums</strong></p>
<p>When interest rates rise, Call options premium increase and Put Options premium decrease. So, Calls have Positive Rho and Puts Rho is negative.</p>
<p class="bodytextblack">Now. having understood the Greeks, please use this calculator and enter into paper trades and I&#8217; sure you will discover a strategy that fits your trading style.</p>

The issue proceeds will be utilized for loan repayment,buying fleet and working capital requirements.</p>
<p>The company is considering a pre-IPO placement of 968000 shares. If this goes through, the shares issued to the public would be reduced to that extent.</p>
<p>Is the issue worth subscribing to? Find out in our unbiased review:</p>
<p><strong>1.MOAT</strong></p>
<p>Accuracy&#8217;s niche is that it focuses on granite and marble logistics (inland and exports). The company owns 150 vehicles and operates mainly in the Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra. It faces a lot of competition, and in that sense it is has a below-average moat.</p>
<p>However, one thing to note is that the company has been adding fleet every year and that is a good sign.</p>
<p><strong>2. A CURIOUS CASE</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a question:</p>
<p>If you own a company that requires massive working capital, and you have obtained a whole lot of finance in the last 5 years, faced negative cash flow issues in the past. own subsidiaries that are in losses, and work in an intensely competitive field, would you or other promoters float a firm that competes with the main company?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what your answer to the question is, but Accuracy Shipping does all of the above activities that are listed in the question. Here&#8217;s the dope:</p>
<p><strong>Negative Cash Flows</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2603" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-3.jpg" alt="accuracy shipping cash flows" width="684" height="406" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-3.jpg 684w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-3-300x178.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Intensive Working Capital Requirement</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2604" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-4.jpg" alt="accuracy shipping working capital" width="628" height="440" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-4.jpg 628w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-4-300x210.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>In house Competition</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2605" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-2.jpg" alt="accuracy shipping in house competition" width="652" height="404" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-2.jpg 652w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-2-300x186.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>3. Financials</strong></p>
<p>Despite the slowdown in exports, the company has clocked a massive rise in turnover for the 9-month period ending on 31-12-17.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2608" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-5.jpg" alt="accuracy shipping financials" width="638" height="267" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-5.jpg 638w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/accuracy-shipping-5-300x126.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s book value was 21 as on 31-12-17.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that rising oil prices will hit its profitability in the near term until these prices recede.</p>
<p>The long term debt is 27 crore and the short term debt is about 12 crore. That makes it 39 crores. Now, the interest provided is 2.50 crores, which works out to a 6.4% rate of interest. This can be because the loans may have been obtained towards the end of the year. Still it is a factor that you should clarify before applying.</p>
<p>The post issue capital will be about 15 crores and assuming the current profitability is maintained, the EPS for 2018-19 would work out to about Rs 4.55. At Rs 84 issue price, the PE works out to 19, which seems fully priced for a new entrant.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;d wait for the stock to list before considering trading it. Smallcaps too are falling and many are available at very attractive prices. In such a situation it is best to be a fence sitter.</p>

<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Do you know what an Out-Of-The-Money Option is?</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/options/the-basics-of-options-trading/"><strong>If you are unfamiliar with options terms, read this article first</strong></a>.</p>
<p>If you buy out-of-the-money options at unreasonable premiums or at far away strike prices, an Options Writer will consider you to be an extremely rash trader. This is being politely.</p>
<p>To be blunt, he regards you as an idiot trader but nevertheless loves you, because&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>AN OPTIONS WRITER MAKES HIS MONEY BY EATING PREMIUMS FROM THE OPTIONS HE WRITES (SELLS).</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE OPTIONS WRITER ALSO KNOWS THAT <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AT LEAST 50%</span> OF OPTIONS EXPIRE WITHOUT BEING EXERCISED</strong>. So, if he plays it right, his chances of making profits are up at least 50% even before he starts writing.</p>
<p>The Options Writer is an extremely sharp trader who works with tools that constantly update him on the profit or loss potential of the option he has sold.</p>
<p>We will get to these tools at the end of the article. Let&#8217;s start:</p>
<h2>SECRETS OF OPTIONS WRITERS</h2>
<p><strong>1:</strong> Options writers know that shorting options is a dangerous game and therefore <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they largely square up their position by the end of the day</strong> </span>unless the profit margin is massive (in which case they set a higher Stop Loss in the next trading session).</p>
<p><strong>2:</strong> Options writers <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>always judge the trend</strong></span>. If the trend is bearish, they <strong>Write Call Options.</strong></p>
<p>If the trend is bullish, they <strong>Write Put Options.</strong></p>
<p>As an example, the trend these days (1-6-18) is that Nifty stocks are rising while the midcaps are falling. So the Options Writers will be active writing calls of FNO stocks that do not feature in the Nifty.</p>
<p>Similarly, when a particular sector becomes a hot topic of discussion, like in the case of consumer durable stocks a couple of weeks back, the Options Writers will write Put options of such stocks and indices.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important to judge the market trend if you are a Options Writer.</p>
<p><strong>3:</strong> These writers <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>love stocks that are not volatile</strong></span>.</p>
<p>The idea is to eat premiums on OTM calls and non volatile stocks do not fluctuate much and therefore writers are not too worried about writing both calls and puts.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take the example of Infosys which is around 1100. If the annual volatility of the stock is around 10%, it means that the stock will fluctuate in a band of 990-1210 in a year. This implies a fluctuation of Rs 110 either way in a year, which works out to about Rs 9 per month.</p>
<p>So, in such a case the writers are emboldened to write both puts and calls of 1080 (and below) and 1120 (and above) for a given day and walk away with the premiums. Of course if there&#8217;s a massive fluctuation in Infosys, they will lose. But by and large this strategy works out in 8/10 stocks.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They also love to sell strangles in non-volatile stocks</strong></span>. A strangle is a strategy in which a trader buys an OTM PE and CE of a volatile stock because he expects the combined premium to move up. In non-volatile stock, the reverse happens (premium moves down)..</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/options/how-to-discover-volatile-and-not-volatile-stocks-for-applying-options-strategies/"><strong>Now the question is how to discover volatility per stock and for that you must refer this article</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>4:</strong> Options writers <strong>do NOT focus on just one or two stocks</strong>.</p>
<p>Writing calls and puts for many stocks (some non-volatile, some at overpriced premiums, some at far away strike prices) hedges their risk.</p>
<p>Therefore, the goal is to diversify and not get hooked on to a couple of stocks. Also, writers are cold, calculative and unemotional people.</p>
<p><strong>5:</strong> Options writers write at strike prices that are  about <strong>15% Out of the Money</strong></p>
<p>Typically, the option writer correlates volatility to the time value of the option. The assumption is that by now you know how to measure volatility (see link above).</p>
<p>If you are yet unfamiliar with the terms, start again and read the Options Basics article that I have linked to.</p>
<p>The Options Writer selects options that are significantly out of the money because he knows that the stock will move up hugely only if there&#8217;s a massive move.</p>
<p>OTM Options whose strike prices are +/-15% will likely not be exercised and therefore there are high chances of such options making money for the Writer.</p>
<p><strong>6:</strong> Options writers also love to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>write options when the premium is overpriced</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Now remember this &#8211; the Options Writer is mostly looking to square up his position by the end of the day, so he doesn&#8217;t care what happens tomorrow.</p>
<p>Therefore, he will calculate the fair value of the stock or index (underlying) and if he finds that the premiums are overpriced, he will write the option even though its strike price is closer to the CMP.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They typically write options that are more than 20% overpriced</strong></span>.</p>
<p>These writers have <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>sophisticated surveillance tools</strong></span> that alert them about overpriced premiums, about their live profit and loss position, and cases where premiums begin to spike.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t and therefore you can use online tools to determine if the premium is fair or not. <a href="https://bullbull.in/option-premium-value/"><strong>One such tool is located here</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> Finally, you need to understand <strong>Options Greeks, which are made up of delta, gamma, vega, theta and rho.</strong></p>
<p>Option writers use their values to figure out trades.</p>
<p>This is a rather long topic and I&#8217;ll write a post about it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can start doing paper trades from the knowledge you gathered if you want to become an Options Writer. It will take you at least a month and several paper trades to get the hang of the trade.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you are a plain vanilla investor or an options buyer, then use the information above to understand what to do and what not to do.</p>

<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/market-iq/how-to-analyze-open-interest-data-and-generate-profitable-swing-trades/"><strong>To understand the basic concept of Open Interest (OI), please read through this article</strong></a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now assuming that you now know how OI is calculated and that you know the implications.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 1: <a href="https://www.nseindia.com/live_market/dynaContent/live_watch/option_chain/optionKeys.jsp">Let&#8217;s open the Nifty Options Chain Page for 28 June 2017</a>:</strong></p>
<p>Date: <strong>1 June 2018</strong> &#8211; Time <strong>1.27 PM</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nifty-OPTION-CHAIN.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2554" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nifty-OPTION-CHAIN.jpg" alt="How to analyze options chain" width="1258" height="735" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nifty-OPTION-CHAIN.jpg 1258w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nifty-OPTION-CHAIN-300x175.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nifty-OPTION-CHAIN-768x449.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nifty-OPTION-CHAIN-1024x598.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1258px) 100vw, 1258px" /></a></p>
<p>Note the shaded portion (in light pink tones, both on the left and on the right).</p>
<p><strong>It represents In The Money Strike Prices</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is what In The Money and Out of The Money Strike Prices imply:</p>
<p><strong>A. In the Money (ITM)</strong></p>
<p><strong>– (For Call options) </strong>When strike price is below the stock price. Example, if you buy Nifty 10200CE and the spot price is 10700.</p>
<p><strong>– (For Put options) </strong>When strike price is above the stock price. Example, if you buy Nifty 10800PE and the spot price is 10700.</p>
<p><strong>At the Money (ATM) – </strong>When strike price is equal to the stock price. Example, if you buy Nifty 10700CE or PE and the spot price is 10700.</p>
<p><strong>B. Out of the Money (OTM)</strong></p>
<p><strong>– (For Call options) </strong>When strike price is above the stock price. Example, if you buy Nifty 10800CE and the spot price is 10700.</p>
<p><strong>– (For Put options) </strong>When strike price is below the stock price. Example, if you buy Nifty 10500PE and the spot price is 10700.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Understand the concepts of Call and Put Writing</strong></p>
<p>A writer of a call or a put is a seller.</p>
<p>He sells both calls and puts because he feels the strike prices won&#8217;t hit and he will earn the premium. He also assumes that any buyer of an OTM call or Put is a rash trader.</p>
<p>This is why call and put writers are very active in Out-of-the-Money strike prices, and this is where we must get our clues from.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Copy the Data and paste on an Excel Sheet</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve copied all data and pasted it on an Excel sheet focusing on strike prices between 10050 and 11200.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-OI.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2556" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-OI.jpg" alt="how to read option chain" width="966" height="452" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-OI.jpg 966w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-OI-300x140.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-OI-768x359.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Interpret The OTM Call Writing </strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve highlighted the rows which saw the maximum addition.</p>
<ol>
<li>10,800 CE added 118,527 volume to OI making the OI balloon to 2,182,500 &#8211; this means call writers are reasonably confident that Nifty will have a very tough time crossing 10,800.</li>
<li>10,900 CE added 745,800 volume, ballooning the OI to 2,207, 850 &#8211; this means call writers are reasonably confident that Nifty will also have a very tough time crossing 10,900.</li>
<li>The call writers also felt that crossing 11,000 CE  is another tough call judging from the fact that 92,110 volume was added to OI taking it to 3,782,625. The change in OI was highest at 11,000 indicating that writers were supremely confident that it was almost impossible for the Nifty to cross 11,000.</li>
</ol>
<p>As of today, the call writers feel that Nifty will face it extremely tough to cross 10,800 and beyond, and therefore are happily selling (writing) calls.</p>
<p>It may be that this position gets reversed tomorrow (for example, oil can drop $5, or government can announce a PSU divestment program, etc.). If the position gets reversed, these call writers will get trapped and will have to cover their shorts.</p>
<p>If it comes to covering their shorts, Nifty has the capability of shooting beyond 11,200 purely based on short covering.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Interpret The OTM Put Writing </strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve highlighted the rows which saw the maximum addition.</p>
<ol>
<li>10,600 PE added 97,667 volume taking OI to 3,473,925. This is the highest OI on the Put side and it implies that Put writers are more or less confident that Nifty will not crack 10,600. Note that there was a spurt in OI added, which implies that sellers are very confident not breaking 10,600.</li>
<li>10,700 PE added 90,592 volume taking OI to 2,153,625. It implies that Put writers are more or less confident that Nifty will not crack 10,650. The addition to OI at this Put Strike price was 894,900, which shows the confidence of the Put writers.</li>
</ol>
<p>As of today, put writers feel that Nifty will face it extremely tough to break 10,600 and below, and therefore are happily selling (writing) puts between 10600-10700.</p>
<p>It may be that this position gets reversed tomorrow (for example, Shiv Sena and JDU can ditch the BJP, or oil can rise $5/barrel, etc.). If the position gets reversed, these put writers will get trapped and will have to cover their shorts.</p>
<p>If it comes to covering their shorts, Nifty has the capability of falling below 10,600 and possibly up to 10,200 which represents the next confidence level of the put writers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Checking the position on the Charts</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/a-live-trade-setup-that-can-generate-super-profits/">Please read this article before reading the analysis</a>.</p>
<p><strong>a. The 1 Week Charts of the Nifty at 2.58 PM</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-Chain-on-char.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2560" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-Chain-on-char.jpg" alt="how to chart check options OI" width="1347" height="570" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-Chain-on-char.jpg 1347w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-Chain-on-char-300x127.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-Chain-on-char-768x325.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nifty-Options-Chain-on-char-1024x433.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1347px) 100vw, 1347px" /></a></p>
<p>Though Supertrend suggests a weak trend, you can see that the Nifty is very close to breaking the Supertrend barrier.</p>
<p>The Nifty also hasn&#8217;t broken the Ichimoku Base and Conversion Lines.</p>
<p>The 20Day EMA is still higher than the 50-day EMA.</p>
<p>The MACD Line has crossed above the Signal Line and that is another bullish signal.</p>
<p>Therefore I would say the weekly chart is bullish.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2564" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o.jpg" alt="nifty hourly charts for options" width="1347" height="570" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o.jpg 1347w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o-300x127.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o-768x325.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o-1024x433.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1347px) 100vw, 1347px" /></a>b. The 1 Day Charts of the Nifty at 2.58 PM</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-Chain-on-charts.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2563" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-Chain-on-charts.jpg" alt="how to extrapolate options OI on charts" width="1347" height="570" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-Chain-on-charts.jpg 1347w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-Chain-on-charts-300x127.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-Chain-on-charts-768x325.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-Chain-on-charts-1024x433.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1347px) 100vw, 1347px" /></a></p>
<p>Super trend is bearish but the Nifty can easily breakout on a gap up opening, or a reasonable rise during a trading day.</p>
<p>The Nifty is still above the Ichimoku Base and Conversion Lines.</p>
<p>The MACD suggests a bullish signal.</p>
<p>The 20D EMA is above the 50D EMA.</p>
<p>It is easy to tell Nifty is an uptrend.</p>
<p><strong>c. The 1 Hour Charts of the Nifty at 2.58 PM</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2564" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o.jpg" alt="nifty hourly charts for options" width="1347" height="570" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o.jpg 1347w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o-300x127.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o-768x325.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NSE-Options-1hour-period-o-1024x433.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1347px) 100vw, 1347px" /></a></p>
<p>3 indicators (Supertrend, Ichimoku and EMAs) suggest an uptrend while the MACD seems weak, but has not turned bearish.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Reconciling Options OI with Charts</strong></p>
<p>The Options OI for the 28 June 2018 expiry suggests that call and put writers estimate that the Nifty would move in a range f 10600 to 10900.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s do one thing &#8211; let&#8217;s measure the total call and put writers in a (+) (-) 200 to 300 points range.</p>
<p>The Nifty is currently at 10696 (3.30 PM).</p>
<p>The total number of Put Writers between 10450-10700 are 8,948,550.</p>
<p>The total number of Call Writers between 10800-11000 are 8,392,050.</p>
<p>Put Writers exceed Call Writers and therefore the writers are more confident in selling OTM PEs.</p>
<p>So, the analysis is that the writers expect the market to be in the 10600-10900 range and the charts suggest that the markets are more bullish than bearish.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Deciding what to do</strong></p>
<p>After analysis, I would buy an In-The-Money or At-The-Money CE for June Expiry and hold with a SL for 2-3 days.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Anticipating The Change In Trend</strong></p>
<p>This article was written on 1 June 2018 and the expiry is on 28 June. It is possible that the trend changes quickly and therefore you should assume this trend is valid for 2-3 days.</p>
<h2><strong>You can try this strategy on any FNO stock. The chances of success will be greater than that of failure, but you should always work with stop losses.</strong></h2>

<p>This guide will help you tell with a large degree of certainty that the trade you are about to enter  into has a good chance of succeeding.</p>
<p>Before you start, <a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/a-live-trade-setup-that-can-generate-super-profits/"><strong>please read our trade setup that can help you generate profits</strong></a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m writing this post in response to a query on &#8220;why Shankara Building Products is falling?&#8221; on our Mumbai Whatsapp group.</p>
<p>I started analyzing the stock and was surprised to see that our trade setup had generated a sell call at 1830.</p>
<p>But that got me thinking.</p>
<p>If our trade setup generates a sell or a buy call for a particular period (minutes, hours, day or week), what should a trader do to ensure that the signal has more chances of succeeding than failing.</p>
<p>This post will help you ensure just that.</p>
<p><strong>So, after you identify a stock, here is what you should do:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>KNOW THAT THE ORDER THAT YOU SHOULD CHECK CHARTS IS</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a. 1-Hour Chart</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>b. 1-Day Chart</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>c. 1-Week Chart</strong></span></p>
<p>But the significance of each time period is explained in reverse order for better understanding.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 1: LOOK AT THE WEEKLY CHART FOR THE BIG PICTURE</strong></p>
<p>The weekly charts present the big picture that generally holds good for the medium term. This is the first chart you must check to know the general trend.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2534" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-1.jpg" alt="how to read weekly charts" width="1341" height="634" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-1.jpg 1341w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-1-300x142.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-1-768x363.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-1-1024x484.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1341px) 100vw, 1341px" /></a></p>
<p>The analysis, if you have read our trade setup, is easy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shankara Building Products was in an uptrend but it broke this week &#8211; actually today (31 May 2018).</li>
<li> ST signaled a downtrend</li>
<li> Price fell below Ichimoku and 13D and 48D EMAs.</li>
<li>The MACD line fell below the Signal line above the Zero line which is another bearish signal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, the trader will ask that the trade setup gave a sell signal on the most crucial day (31 May 2018), and therefore what use if the trade setup.</p>
<p>Right, let&#8217;s now move to the 1 day charts of the same stock.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 2: LOOK AT THE DAILY CHART FOR THE SHORT-TERM PICTURE</strong></p>
<p>The DAILY charts present the short term picture  and you must check this immediately after checking the big picture.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2536" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-2.jpg" alt="how to read 1 day charts" width="1341" height="595" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-2.jpg 1341w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-2-300x133.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-2-768x341.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-2-1024x454.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1341px) 100vw, 1341px" /></a></p>
<p>The analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li> ST signaled a downtrend today (31-5-18)</li>
<li> Price fell below Ichimoku cloud supports and the 13D and 48D EMAs. The Ichimoku cloud is also turning red.</li>
<li>The MACD line fell below the Signal line above the Zero line when the stock was 1890. The interpretation is that the MACD crossover should be considered as an alert, but maybe not a full blown trade signal because at that time there was no confirmation by other indicators.</li>
</ol>
<p>Right, let&#8217;s now move to the 1 Hour charts of the same stock, WHICH ARE USED TO DECIDE WHETHER TO ENTER INTO A TRADE.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 3: LOOK AT THE HOURLY CHART TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOU SHOULD ENTER INTO A TRADE</strong></p>
<p>The HOURLY chart signals should be used to enter into a trade present the short term picture  and you must check this immediately after checking the big picture.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2538" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-3.jpg" alt="how to read hourly charts" width="1341" height="595" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-3.jpg 1341w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-3-300x133.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-3-768x341.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-3-1024x454.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1341px) 100vw, 1341px" /></a></p>
<p>The analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li> ST, EMA and MACD signaled a sell at 1825 on 24-5-18.</li>
<li> Price fell below Ichimoku cloud supports and the 13D and 48D EMAs on 25 and 26 May 2018. The Ichimoku cloud also turned red.</li>
<li>The MACD signaled a sell around 1820 on 25-5-18.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOW LET&#8217;S READ THE CHARTS IN REVERSE ORDER:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>On 24-5-18 the 1 Hour charts signaled a SELL. This was confirmed on 25th and 26th.</li>
<li>Going back, the 1Day MACD signaled a sell on the charts at 1890. The price also started breaking the 13 Day EMA on 25-5-18.</li>
<li>On the weekly charts, before 31-5-18, Shankara Buildcon was in an uptrend.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>THEREFORE, at best, in the period between 24-5-18 and 30-5-18, Shankara Buildcon made for a STBT candidate because the weekly chart was in an uptrend.</strong></p>
<p><strong>However, if you held the stock, all the signals said that you should book profits at least on 24-5-18 when the price was 1820.</strong></p>
<p><strong>At the time of writing this article, Shankara Buildcon is at 1697 after having tested 1427.  Had you sold at 1820 per our trade setup, you would have made anywhere between 130 and 400 bucks a share within 7 days. </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If at the end of the day (today on 31-5-18) the weekly chart reverses the downtrend, you can always change your strategy.</strong></span></p>
<p>And this is exactly what happened. Check the chart. The weekly period reversed from the downtrend:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2543" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-4.jpg" alt="how to accurately read charts" width="1346" height="599" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-4.jpg 1346w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-4-300x134.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-4-768x342.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shankara-4-1024x456.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1346px) 100vw, 1346px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>This is how you check chart periods and determine if a stock is good enough for a trade.</strong></p>

<p>Is it worth applying to?</p>
<p>Find out in our no-holds barred review.</p>
<p><strong>BUSINESS AND MOAT</strong></p>
<p>The company is into the corporate gifting business. It makes clocks in bulk for companies wishing to give these away as mementos for any occasion.</p>
<p>By and large, the company imports clock stuff (fancy designs, etc.), assembles these here and brands them with their client&#8217;s logo. Exports make up about 40% of sales (2017).</p>
<p>The promoter&#8217;s in the clock business since 32 years, and that&#8217;s a positive sign.</p>
<p>The company is well entrenched in the market and so long corporates keep gifting clocks, it will do well.</p>
<p><strong>QUIRKY VEHICLE LOANS</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2520" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam1.jpg" alt="sonam clock ipo car loans" width="747" height="315" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam1.jpg 747w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam1-300x127.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px" /></a></p>
<p>Promoters buy cars in their personal name and company pays the loans. Shouldn&#8217;t the title be in the company&#8217;s name? Though the amount is not significant, the accounting practice is not desirable.</p>
<p><strong>REPAYMENT OF LOAN TO PROMOTER</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2521" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam2.jpg" alt="sonam clock ipo objectives" width="724" height="127" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam2.jpg 724w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam2-300x53.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></a></p>
<p>One of the objectives of the issue is to repay a 2 crore loan to the promoter.</p>
<p>So if I have a 32 years of experience in a company, run a successful business and own an established brand, and have given a 2 crore loan to my company, why would I get it repaid through an IPO? Wouldn&#8217;t I rather be repaid with retained earnings and use the IPO proceeds for expanding business?</p>
<p><strong>NEGATIVE CASH FLOWS</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2522" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam3.jpg" alt="SONAM CLOCK CASH FLOWS" width="740" height="217" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam3.jpg 740w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam3-300x88.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></a></p>
<p>An established brand and business with a promoter with decades of experience is expected to generate positive cash flows at the operational level.</p>
<p><strong>IN HOUSE COMPETITION</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2523" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam4.jpg" alt="sonam clocks competition" width="742" height="252" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam4.jpg 742w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam4-300x102.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px" /></a></p>
<p>The promoters own another company that freely competes with the one issuing the shares. Conflict of interest always weakens any business.</p>
<p><strong>BASIS FOR PRICING</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2524" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam5.jpg" alt="sonam clock basis for pricing" width="739" height="242" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam5.jpg 739w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sonam5-300x98.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /></a></p>
<p>The weighted average of the EPS BEFORE the IPO is 1.28. This will bet diluted post issue. The company is issuing shares at Rs 36, which results in a PE (pre IPO) of 28. Post IPO the PE will be higher.</p>
<p>The issue is at a high price.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>IMO the issue is priced very high and therefore I would give it a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>MISS</strong></span>.</p>
