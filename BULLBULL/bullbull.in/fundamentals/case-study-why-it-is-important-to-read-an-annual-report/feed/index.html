		<description><![CDATA[So where are the amortised liabilities accounted? How much are the gold leases and where does the gold lease liability figure? What is the composition of the trade payables?

Also, Note 30 talks about interest amount paid on loans :Interest expense on financial liabilities at amortised cost: which is Rs 221Cr, a breakdown of Rs274Cr. Any thought on it.]]></description>

3. Inventory point is semi-conceded except for the fact that if it comes to selling off gold for an export business,, its brand will suffer and it will incur losses.
4. Can you with all your superior analytical skills figure out what assets the company would have pledged for its gold leases?
