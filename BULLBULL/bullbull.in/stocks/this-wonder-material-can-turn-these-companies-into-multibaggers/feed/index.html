Re private companies.. when there are public companies available for making profits, why jump into an unregulated investment with a long gestation period?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Sunil Sir,
I had done some googling regarding Archit Organosys carbon nanotech plans. I came accross a profile in www.researchgate.net 
https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Suchit_Amin/inf 
I think this Suchit amin is the second son of KANDARP KRISHNAKANT AMIN and ARCHANA KANDARP AMIN who are the wholetime directors of the company. His feild of skills and expertise are given as Carbon Nanomaterials, Nanomaterials,   Advanced Materials etc in the said profile. So if the wholetime directors son is involved in the technology they may not require other proffesionals to lead them. 
Sunil sir, how do you think about investing in a private company in graphene and carbon nano tech sector. https://ad-nanotech.com. They have an investor link in their site https://ad-nanotech.com/invest-on-graphene.html
I dont know about investing in private companies. I don&#039;t know the company is competent enough or not. I don&#039;t have the resources or expertise to check that. But thier website looks good. Also a very small investor like me may not be entertained by them. They may be looking for some PE investors or big angel investors.

		<description><![CDATA[sir,
would you please study whether Archit Organosys has any capablities and plans to devolop nano carbon technologies. I once came across a post in a forrum http://rakesh-jhunjhunwala.in/forum/threads/what-will-be-next-10x-or-100-x-multibaggers-stocks.874/page-10#post-20442.  when I googled regarding this i came across a site named archit advanced materials and it had mentions about nanocarbon technology. I entered into it at 65/-then they issued rights (1:2) at 25/- when market price was 90/- and its price got adjusted to 40-50 lvls and is currently trading in that range. But when i recently searched about archit advanced materials i was not able to find the site. Now i doubt that they have left the idea of devoloping advanced materials. Also small companies like Archit can have difficulties in retaining    the proffesionals who were responsible for devoloping the high end technologies.
