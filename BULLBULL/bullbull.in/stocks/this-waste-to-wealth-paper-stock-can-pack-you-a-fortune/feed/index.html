		<description><![CDATA[No one deleted any comment, please be assured of that.. all comments need approval and I just got to the computer

The world over, plastic tableware is being banned. France has already done it. Yash is trying to capture a slice of the market. Their debt is 72 cr and the DE is 1.32.. I don&#039;t find it a negative considering the potential

Well, there are many companies that have pledged more than 80% of their stock and it is a worry. So, if you are skeptical, please do not invest.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Sir,
I feel someone deleted my query which I had posted some hours ago, but nevermind.

I feel Waste-to-Wealth would help the environment to an extent, but to talk about the numericals about the YASH PAPERS - 

1. The company has a debt of approx. 136CR, which is almost 85% of its market cap(153).
2. The promoters have pledged 100% of the stock.

I feel this is some negatives about the company. being in debt the interest paid ratio would high, dividend pay would be less and few others.
Please update and educate me in right direction for my research in YP.]]></description>
