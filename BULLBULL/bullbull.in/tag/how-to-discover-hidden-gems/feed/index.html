<p>Financial statements reflect what has happened in the past, while stock prices always discount the future.</p>
<p>And, one way you can figure out where a stock is headed is to keep tabs on insider trading.</p>
<p>Employees, directors, owners and shareholders buy (or sell) their own company&#8217;s stock wither when prices are low as compared to its potential or when they figure something big is about to happen.</p>
<p>In 9.9 cases out of 10 insiders know what is happening inside a company. They are privy to marketing information, price<br />
increases, cost savings, order increases, sectoral information, results of lobbying with the government, company selling real estate assets, open offers, buy back plans, etc.</p>
<p>The great thing is that SEBI and the stock exchanges require all companies to report details on insider trading, which is published DAILY online.</p>
<h3><strong>AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO THROUGH THE ONLINE INFORMATION DAILY TO FIGURE OUT STOCKS THAT WILL WITNESS INSIDER PRICE ACTION.</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s how you can do that:</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bseindia.com">Bombay Stock Exchange</a> is your best bet to unearthing insider trading activity.</p>
<p>Open the site and head to Corporate Announcements</p>
<p>Click on the More &gt;&gt; link at the bottom right</p>
<p>Now you will view &gt; Disclosures (http://www.bseindia.com/corporates/ann.aspx?expandable=0 )</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-284 alignleft" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Insider-Trading-Knowledge-B-300x246.jpg" alt="insider trading page BSE" width="300" height="246" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Insider-Trading-Knowledge-B-300x246.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Insider-Trading-Knowledge-B.jpg 594w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Once there, go through each section under &#8220;Disclosures&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Submitted by Company</strong></p>
<p>(a) Insider Trading 2015</p>
<p>(b) Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers (SAST)</p>
<p>(c) Pledge data</p>
<p><strong>Submitted by Registration &amp; Transfer Agent (TRA)</strong></p>
<p>(a) Insider Trading 2015</p>
<p>(b) Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers (SAST)</p>
<p>(c) Pledge data</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a screenshot of Insider Trading data submitted by companies on 28 June 2017:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-283 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Insider-Trading-BSE.jpg" alt="insider trading by companies" width="1117" height="652" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Insider-Trading-BSE.jpg 1117w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Insider-Trading-BSE-300x175.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Insider-Trading-BSE-768x448.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Insider-Trading-BSE-1024x598.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1117px) 100vw, 1117px" /></p>
<p>Notice that the promoter acquisition in AB Nuvo and Reliance is not substantial. TaMO is inter company transfer while the promoter of Steel Strips and Wheels, Dheeraj Garg, has pledged 2,75,000 shares out of more than 46 lakh shares owned by him. The last two are private limited companies.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the information is not substantial to make a buy or sell call on any of these stocks.</p>
<p>BUT&#8230;</p>
<p>The lesson is that you must keep tracking insider deals everyday and I can bet you that you will be able to uncover at least 1 hidden gem every 2 days.</p>
