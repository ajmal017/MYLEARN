<p>The company is into the production of hybrid seeds. It is a competitive field in which even government agencies compete. So it all boils down t the kind of value the company&#8217;s seeds are generating for the farmer, and this depends on their R &amp; D.</p>
<p>The business is seasonal and the company is required to tank up on stocks, necessitating heavy working capital requirements. Its main markets are MP, Maharashtra and Jharkhand, but it is also expanding to other states.</p>
<p>The moat depends on the company&#8217;s ability to create superior seeds and educate the farmer of their advantages. Also, food as a business has a fantastic future given the rising population.</p>
<p><strong>IMPROVING CASH FLOWS:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shreeoswal.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2489" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shreeoswal.jpg" alt="SHREE OSWAL SEEDS CASH FLOWS" width="630" height="335" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shreeoswal.jpg 630w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shreeoswal-300x160.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></a></p>
<p>The cash flows of the company look impressive. The company financed its operations by debt up to 2015 and since then it has been repaying debt. This looks good.</p>
<p><strong>SUBSIDIARY </strong></p>
<p>Shree Oswal Psyllium processes and sells psyllium husk (Sat Isabgol), and belongs 100% to the parent company.</p>
<p><strong>FINANCIALS</strong></p>
<p>Checked the financials up to 30 November 2017.  The company also had provided BS from 1 April 2017 to 30 January 2018 and P/L for December and January 2018. Comparing 2018 figures would have caused confusion and therefore I stuck to analyzing up to 30 November 2017.</p>
<p>On sales of 35 crores, the company generated a net profit after tax of 88 lakhs. It&#8217;s a lo 2.5% margin, but what is good is that the operational cash flows were positives and the company paid 45 lakhs tax.</p>
<p>But the short term debt is massive. Against a pre-IPO capital of Rs 6.17 crore, the long term debt is 6.34 crores and the short term debt is 19.87 crores. Though the short term debt is adequately covered by the inventories, the interest will hit the company&#8217;s profitability.</p>
<p><strong>ISSUE PRICING</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shreeoswal2-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2491" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shreeoswal2-1.jpg" alt="shree oswal seeds general reserves" width="622" height="257" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shreeoswal2-1.jpg 622w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shreeoswal2-1-300x124.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px" /></a></p>
<p>The first thing that strikes is that the Reserves and Surplus are very low, and the company is issuing shares at RS 26, a premium of Rs 16.</p>
<p>Granted that the promoters have worked very hard to repay their old loans, but for that they have been rewarded by a reduced cost of acquisition of shares at Rs 10 per share.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Rs 15 (Rs 5 premium) would have been an investor-friendly IPO price.</p>
<p><strong>EQUITY SHARE CAPITAL</strong></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s equity capital was 6.16 crores.</p>
<p>On 26 February 2018, about 45 lakh shares were issued at Rs 10.25 in lieu of Rs 4.4 crore loan to the company.</p>
<p>So, prior to the issue, the capital is Rs 10.66 crores.</p>
<p>Add to this another 45.78 lakh shares of the IPO and we get a share capital of Rs 16.44 crores.</p>
<p>The profit for 8 months ended 30 November 2017 was 89 lakhs, so let&#8217;s say the profit for the whole year would work up to Rs 1.4 crores.</p>
<p>That leaves us with an EPS of Re 0.85.</p>
<p>The IPO is priced at a PE of 30.5, which is very aggressive.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>All in all, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>this looks like a decent IPO except for the fact it is priced high</strong></span>. There are insignificant legal issues, the promoters have bought the shares at par, the company is in the ever-growing food business, etc., etc.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I would buy the stock in the open market if it falls to Rs 12-15. </strong></span></p>
