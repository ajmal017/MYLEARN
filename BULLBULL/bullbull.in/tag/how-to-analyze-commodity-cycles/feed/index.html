<h3>Here is a practical lesson on how to predict commodity cycles.</h3>
<h1><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Example</strong>: Copper</span></h1>
<h2><strong>STEP 1</strong>: Access Historical Charts</h2>
<p>I Googled &#8220;Copper Price Historical Chart,&#8221; and landed on this <a href="http://www.macrotrends.net/1476/copper-prices-historical-chart-data"><strong>45 year chart</strong>.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Copper-historical-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1991" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Copper-historical-1.jpg" alt="predict copper super cycle" width="768" height="582" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Copper-historical-1.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Copper-historical-1-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>The recessionary periods are represented by vertical gray bars. As you can see that the prices of copper started spiking from 2003-04 onwards, crashed after the 2008 bust and then picked up from 2010. Volumes also have picked up from 2010 on, and the copper price spiked to $4.50 (per lb) by 2013-14, and then subsequently corrected. Thereafter it resumed its upward march and is currently at around $3.05 with support at $1.50 and resistance at $4.50. As you can see, the volumes have picked up in recent years, which is a bullish signal.</p>
<h2><strong>STEP </strong>2: Search For The Commodity&#8217;s Global Global Demand in the Near Future</h2>
<p>The next step was to figure out how copper demand will pan out in the near future. I Googled &#8220;global copper demand 2020&#8221; and landed on a <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://minerals.statedevelopment.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/294631/Copper_to_the_World_Vanessa_Davidson_Keynote_address_27_June_2017.pdf">mid-2017 document that discussed about the global copper demand and supply.</a></span></strong></p>
<p><em>(You can get authoritative documents for any commodity so long you know how to search intelligently on Google.)</em></p>
<p>In this document I learned that:</p>
<p>a. Substantial capacities were added between 2011-16 and that capacities were not expected to increase much between 2017-2021.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-capacities-2020.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1993" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-capacities-2020.jpg" alt="copper mine capacity 2020" width="1097" height="592" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-capacities-2020.jpg 1097w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-capacities-2020-300x162.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-capacities-2020-768x414.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-capacities-2020-1024x553.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1097px) 100vw, 1097px" /></a></p>
<p>b. That demand will outstrip supply as we head towards 2020, a factor that will push prices higher.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-supply-demand-2020.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1995" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-supply-demand-2020.jpg" alt="Copper demand-supply scenario" width="1291" height="596" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-supply-demand-2020.jpg 1291w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-supply-demand-2020-300x138.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-supply-demand-2020-768x355.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/copper-supply-demand-2020-1024x473.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1291px) 100vw, 1291px" /></a></p>
<p>c. That no substantial investment in copper mines is expected so long prices do not rise dramatically.</p>
<p>d. Prices are expected to rise faster than costs, resulting in better margins.</p>
<p>e. That the supply of copper scrap increased substantially, a factor that helped keep prices in check despite demand spiking up.</p>
<p>f. That China&#8217;s industrialization cycle may end by 2026, a factor that will ensure that copper prices do not spike up. In fact, it is expected that copper prices will remain steady after 2026 or taper off.</p>
<h2><strong>STEP 3</strong>: Search for the Commodity&#8217;s Uses</h2>
<div>Googling &#8220;uses of copper&#8221; helped me discover that copper is used in the following applications:</div>
<div></div>
<div>a. Electrical equipment because it conducts heats and electricity efficiently.</div>
<div>b. Construction (plumbing, roofing, etc.)</div>
<div>c. Industrial machinery</div>
<div>d. Water purification</div>
<div>e. As a poison in agriculture (copper sulfate)</div>
<div>f. Other minor applications such as detecting sugar.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The biggest takeway from these uses was that the boom in electric vehicles and technology (advanced electronics that may trigger technological obsolescence) will drive demand for copper going forward.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="https://www.copper.org/education/history/us-history/g_fact_future.html"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>I also Googled &#8220;future uses of copper,</strong></span>&#8220;</a> and learned that copper will be used in the following applications that have potential in the future:</div>
<div></div>
<div>a. Solar energy</div>
<div>b. Earth-coupled heat pumps</div>
<div>c. Electric Vehicles</div>
<div>d. Electronics (as usual)</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<h2><strong>STEP 4</strong>: Global Disruptions</h2>
<p>The world is now cruising uncomfortably on rocking terrain. America has triggered a global trade war, countries are resorting to protectionism, and there are geopolitical tensions (N Korea-USA, Israel-Iran).</p>
<p>Any escalation of any one situation can lead to a drop in commodity prices (except precious metals).</p>
<h2><strong>STEP 5</strong>: Weigh the Bullish and Bearish Factors</h2>

<table id="tablepress-21" class="tablepress tablepress-id-21">
<thead>
<tr class="row-1 odd">
	<th class="column-1">DATE</th><th class="column-2">STOCK</th><th class="column-3">TRANSACTION</th><th class="column-4">WHO</th><th class="column-5">NOTES</th>

<h2><strong>STEP 6</strong>: Analysis</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p> Though demand of copper outstrips supply at the moment, the increased supply of copper scrap and the possibility of capacities getting commissioned have kept prices in check. Nevertheless, the demand for copper will increase as EVs and solar energy applications worm their way into daily life.</p>
<p>At this moment, it will be safe to say that there is nothing majorly bullish about copper because if prices spike up, new capacities will be added very quickly, and existing production disruptions also will get set right, leading to a correction.</p>
<p>Therefore, as things stand, with the possibility of trade wars upon us, we can assume that copper will be range bound with support at $1.50 and resistance at $4.50. Anything over $4 or so will make new capacities kick in.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
</div>
<div> Well, this is more or less it. You can try this method for any commodity and check how it works. You also can dig deeper by Googling for terms such as</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;why is  (commodity&#8217;s) supply disrupted&#8221;</div>
<div>&#8220;seasonal factors that impact (commodity&#8217;s) production (or, demand).&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Good luck, and drop in a line if you found this article helpful.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PS: If I were you, I&#8217;d buy a quality copper scrap recycling stock and hold it for 3 years. It will become a sure multibagger.</strong></span></div>
