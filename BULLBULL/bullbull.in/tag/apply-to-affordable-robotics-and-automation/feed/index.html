Is the issue worth subscribing to? Here&#8217;s an unbiased review:</strong></p>
<p><strong>MOAT:</strong></p>
<p>The company operates a robotics facility (machines/software) that offers turnkey automated solutions (design and prototype) for the automotive industry, and it also creates car parking solutions  for clients in Pune and Mumbai (as in complex car parking systems that you see in malls).</p>
<p>Basically the company gets an order, makes some prototypes, gets the customer&#8217;s sign off and installs the required paraphenalia at the customer&#8217;s plant. It can even set up a new facility for customers.</p>
<p>It is headed by an experienced technocrat, Milind Padole.</p>
<p>For designing parts, the company uses licensed software (it does not own any in-house developed software).</p>
<p>It has collaborations in China, Taiwan and Netherlands, and their PDF also owns a facility in China. It services reputed clients such as Maruti, Volvo, Eicher, M&amp;M, Tata, Ashok Leyland, etc.</p>
<p><strong>One new and very exciting business that the company has entered into is the secondary packaging business which  involves picking up used plastic bottles, refurbishing these, and refilling with water, etc. This type of recycling business has fantastic potential given the problem of plastic waste we face.</strong></p>
<p>Note that the automation business is growing rapidly in India and the space is getting very competitive. Though the company&#8217;s business model looks good especially considering EVs still have to take off, we can say that the moat is above average for now, and its strength will depend on what the company does going forward.</p>
<p><strong>TAX ISSUES:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2379" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-2.jpg" alt="affordable robotics issue graded" width="806" height="266" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-2.jpg 806w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-2-300x99.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-2-768x253.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px" /></a></p>
<p>The company has faced tax issues in the past and has an outstanding demand of Rs 9.55 crore towards direct and indirect taxes. In March 2018, the company paid 3.32 crores and from that date, Rs 6.23 crores may be outstanding. There is no clarity on the current situation, and time will provide the answers.</p>
<p><strong>ERRATIC CASH FLOWS:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2380" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-4.jpg" alt="affordable robotics cash flows" width="784" height="335" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-4.jpg 784w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-4-300x128.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-4-768x328.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see in the image, the company has experienced solid spurts and declines in the cash flows. The reason for this could be the fact that though the company was in automation operations since 2005, the actual work started from 2010. Later, it had to invest in car parking solutions, which now contribute 19% of total turnover. This may have squeezed cash flows.</p>
<p><strong>PRICE TO BOOK VALUE:</strong></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s BV is 17 and the issue price is Rs 85, making it 5 times book, which seems expensive.</p>
<p><strong>PROMOTER&#8217;S COST OF ACQUISITION</strong></p>
<p>The promoters have acquired the stock at 40 paise. Well, this is a normal with all SME IPOs and the low cost of acquisition represents the reward to the promoters for their dynamism. So this should not be a factor.</p>
<p><b>INVENTORIES TO SALES:</b></p>
<p>The inventories work up to to 54% of sales, implying that many orders were in process. Therefore, one factor that needs to be checked post-IPO is whether sales increased.</p>
<p><strong>UTILIZATION OF ISSUE PROCEEDS:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2383" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-3.jpg" alt="affordable robotics issue proceeds" width="784" height="349" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-3.jpg 784w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-3-300x134.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-3-768x342.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px" /></a></p>
<p>From the looks of it, the company would be able to easily resolve its debt and working capital requirements post-issue, which is a good sign.</p>
<p><strong>ISSUE PRICING:</strong></p>
<p>The weighted EPS for the last 3 years works out to Rs 3.85 pre IPO. You can say that the issue is fully priced. The NAV pre-IPO is 17.54 (31-3-17).</p>
<p><strong>COMPETITION:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2384" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-5.jpg" alt="affordable robotics competition" width="822" height="129" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-5.jpg 822w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-5-300x47.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/robotics-5-768x121.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px" /></a></p>
<p>According to the prospectus, the company has no listed competitors and therefore peer comparison isn&#8217;t possible.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong>:</p>
<p>Though it seems fully priced, Affordable Robotics &amp; Automation seems to have that X factor that most SME issues lack. The new business of refilling also seems very exciting. The company looks like a medium-long term horse to bet on. Plus, there are high chances of listing gains as well.</p>
