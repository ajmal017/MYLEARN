<h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please use the tool after 3.30 PM on any market day for predicting trends. Day traders can use it after 2 PM after meaningful volumes have built up.</span></h1>
<h4>Technical analysts say that volume always precedes price action and that is why technicals are more important than fundamentals (which represent figures of the past).</h4>
<p>They are right, Technicals are actually more important when it comes to predicting trends.</p>
<p>BUT&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>There is one factor that is more important than technicals. In fact, this factor is akin to a leading indicator of forthcoming technical action.</p></blockquote>
<p>This factor is open interest.</p>
<p>In the NSE Futures and Options segment, investors can pick up shares in bulk by paying a small margin.</p>
<p>For example, if you figure BHEL will trend up, you can buy the 31 Aug CE of 150 at a mere 5 bucks (5,000 shares make 1 lot). So, by investing Rs 25,000, you are effectively creating a buy position of Rs 7.5 lakhs! Then, you can keep rolling over the position (squaring by expiry and then buying afresh).</p>
<p>So, an institution that wants to buy or sell a huge quantity of stocks will typically operate both in the F&amp;O and the cash markets. They may also use options as a hedging strategy (buy in cash market and sell in options market (by buying put options) to hedge against a fall).</p>
<p>I have created a tool, a TREND PREDICTOR, that calculates open interest trades to predict which way stocks and indices will move. It shows you where smart money is headed to. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I have tried it by taking positions and my trades were profitable (Britannia, Manappuram) but KNOW THAT you are responsible for your decisions and so do not take the results thrown up by this tool as a recommendation.</strong></span></p>
<p>Here is a tutorial on how to use it (please follow the captions):</p>
<h4>Before the tutorial, know that THIS TOOL MUST BE USED ONLY AFTER MARKET CLOSES AND DATA IS UPLOADED BECAUSE IF INCOMPLETE DATA IS FED INTO THE TOOL, Â IT WILL GIVE A FALSE SIGNAL.</h4>
<p><strong>STEP ONE</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_456" style="width: 741px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-456 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Trend-Predictor-1.jpg" alt="how to predict which way the stock market will move" width="731" height="610" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Trend-Predictor-1.jpg 731w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Trend-Predictor-1-300x250.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 731px) 100vw, 731px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">STEP 1: Open up: https://bullbull.in/trend-predictor/ Keep it open and open another tab on your browser.</p></div>
<p><strong>STEP TWO</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_464" style="width: 803px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-464 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Trend-Predictor-2.jpg" alt="predict stock market trends with this tool" width="793" height="513" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Trend-Predictor-2.jpg 793w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Trend-Predictor-2-300x194.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Trend-Predictor-2-768x497.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Now open: https://goo.gl/SrYL3F Refresh the page to ensure the data is latest. Remember, you must do this only after market hours (as I have mentioned earlier). You can choose any sector you like. For this example, I have chosen Cement &amp; Construction.</p></div>
<p><strong>STEP THREE</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_463" style="width: 803px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-463 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Trend-Predictor-3.jpg" alt="learn how to tell stock market trends" width="793" height="513" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Trend-Predictor-3.jpg 793w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Trend-Predictor-3-300x194.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Trend-Predictor-3-768x497.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Select the data in the table and copy it (Ctrl + C).</p></div>
<p><strong>STEP FOUR</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_462" style="width: 740px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-462 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Trend-Predictor-4.jpg" alt="Predict NSE and BSE movements to spot multibaggers" width="730" height="513" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Trend-Predictor-4.jpg 730w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Trend-Predictor-4-300x211.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Paste the data in the hollow box provided in BullBull&#8217;s Trend Predictor. Though the box is hollow, it has been programmed to accommodate the table. Hit CALCULATE button after pasting the data.</p></div>
<p><strong>STEP FIVE</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_461" style="width: 740px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-461 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Trend-Predictor-5.jpg" alt="learn how to measure market momentum" width="730" height="513" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Trend-Predictor-5.jpg 730w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Trend-Predictor-5-300x211.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Now scroll down to view the results. Do not forget to interpret the Neutral data, which is explained at the bottom in every result.</p></div>
<p>Finally, remember that these predictions can swing either way depending on news, economic factors, black swan events, etc. Though I have followed best forecasting practices while creating this tool, I suggest you must do your own research and consult your broker before taking positions. I also suggest you to mock trade for a few days to judge whether this tool works and then make your own decision.</p>
<h4>ALL PREDICTIONS OF THIS TOOL ARE LARGELY SHORT TERM.</h4>
