<p>Phone companies will sell phones, optic fibre cable companies will lay cables, infra companies will build roads, and software companies will build apps or online utilities.</p>
<p>Of course, to thrive in such an environment you must be neat and clean and have access to all the basics.</p>
<p>Included in the basics is the toilet/bathroom for all (specifically in villages and small towns).</p>
<p>Building toilets are included in the Swacch Bharat Abhiyan and so that angle is covered.</p>
<p>So what is the need for this article? And what is the multibagger sector we&#8217;re talking about?</p>
<p>Well, this article&#8217;s inspired by a chat I had with a couple of my journalist pals.</p>
<p>Running water is essential for all, and specifically for those living in very small towns and villages. Today toilets are being constructed but these are not equipped with running water.</p>
<p>Therefore, subsequent governments will have to spend on laying pipes if they truly want mofussil India to lead a quality life.</p>
<p>Now, we all know water is a scarce resource and that the day is not far when we will establish powerful desalination plants.</p>
<p>But we need water pipes to transport water from the desalination plant to cities and villages.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure the picture has become clear for you folks.</p>
<p>In the long term (say 4-5 years),Â  WATER PIPE companies will be on cloud 9 and if you invest in these today, you&#8217;ll end up very rich.</p>
<p>Now there are two kinds of water pipes &#8211; PVC and iron ductile. PVC pipes can be violated if they stretch for 100s of miles and therefore iron ductile pipes will be used for transporting water over long distances, while PVC pipes will be used for last mile transport.</p>
<p>Here is a list of companies that operate in this space. I have seen that these stocks are being picked up by strong hands. You too can judge by tracking the price and volume data.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remember that you are responsible for all your financial decisions</span></strong>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be happy if you could pitch in with more company names in the comments section. Thanks.</p>
