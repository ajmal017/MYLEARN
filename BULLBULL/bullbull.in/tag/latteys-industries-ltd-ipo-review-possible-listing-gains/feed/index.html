<p><strong>A. MOAT</strong>:</p>
<p>The company manufactures pumps and motors for the domestic market and about 57% of its revenues are from a single customer (V-Guard Industries). Nothing wrong with that, only thing is that the company will have to spend heavily on marketing expenses should the customer walk away. But then this is a hypothetical situation.</p>
<p>Also, the pumps and motors market is dominated by big players at the top (Kirloskar, Shakti Pumps, etc.). Medium and small players  operate in the market that&#8217;s left over. So, the competition is fierce. Though this is not a negative, the moat doesn&#8217;t seem to be there. However, since we&#8217;re talking water, which is getting scarce in India, the market exists and it is growing.</p>
<p><strong>B. THE FINANCIALS</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Latteys.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2338" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Latteys.jpg" alt="Latteys industries IPO" width="623" height="445" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Latteys.jpg 623w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Latteys-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>OBSERVATION &#8211; 1</strong></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s inventories have doubled (12.08 crore for 6 month period ending 30-9-17 V/S 12.12 crore for year ended 31-3-17)</p>
<p>The trade receivables too have doubled (6.49 crore for 6 month period ending 30-9-17 V/S 6.62 crore for year ended 31-3-17)</p>
<p>The trade payables have jumped about 70% (9.31 crore for 6 month period ending 30-9-17 V/S11.67 crore for year ended 31-3-17)</p>
<p>If you compare these with past year on year increases, then the increases look unusual. For example:</p>
<p>Inventories increased 44% (31-3-2017 v/s 31-3-2016)</p>
<p>Debtors increased 20% (31-3-2017 v/s 31-3-2016)</p>
<p>Trade Payable increased 45% (31-3-2017 v/s 31-3-2016)</p>
<p><strong>OBSERVATION &#8211; 2</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Latteys-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2339" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Latteys-2.jpg" alt="Latteys industries cash flows" width="634" height="181" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Latteys-2.jpg 634w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Latteys-2-300x86.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" /></a></p>
<p>The company has experienced negative cash flows from operations in 2014, and it had invested in  working capital/assets in that year. Both the cash outflows were financed by debt.  Since 2014, the company has experienced positive but small cash flows from operations. It has continuously been investing since then and its debt has kept on rising year on year.</p>
<p><strong>OBSERVATION &#8211; 3</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Latteys-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2344" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Latteys-4.jpg" alt="Latteys industries capital" width="688" height="273" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Latteys-4.jpg 688w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Latteys-4-300x119.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" /></a></p>
<p>As on 30-9-17, the company&#8217;s capital was 3.37 crores (1.58 crores what you see above + 1:1 bonus, etc.) and the reserves were 1.87 crores. All other investments such as fixed assets, inventories, etc., were financed from debt and trade payables.</p>
<p>The net asset value of the stock after the issue would be about Rs 26 as against Rs 10 per share pre issue. Another thing &#8211; the company has compared itself with peers such as Kirloskar, Roto Pumps and Shakti Pumps and priced the issue based on the industry PE. Unsure if the company enjoys the same kind of clout and PE that the biggies are entitled to enjoy.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/latteys-6.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2349" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/latteys-6.jpg" alt="Latteys Industries PE ratio" width="650" height="221" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/latteys-6.jpg 650w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/latteys-6-300x102.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p>The company is issuing shares at Rs 66 and therefore given the capital:reserves position, the issue price looks <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very aggressive</span>. The post issue PE ratio is 50+.</p>
<p><strong>OBSERVATION &#8211; 4</strong></p>
<p>The sales for the 6 month period ending 30-9-17 were 15.24 crores, and the debtors for the same period were 12 crores, implying that 80% of sales were locked up in debtors (so, majority sales pertained to April-June 2017 (the company says it extends a 76 day credit)).</p>
<p><strong>OBSERVATION &#8211; 5</strong></p>
<p>The inventory for the 6 month period ending 30-9-17 was 12 crores, implying aggressive ramp of stocks for future sales. It would be interesting to check whether the company&#8217;s sales increased between July 2017-March 2018.</p>
<p><strong>OBSERVATION &#8211; 6</strong></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s capital as on 30-9-2017 was 3.37 crore and its debt was 10.3 crores (4 crores of which was long term). A high D/E ratio.</p>
<p><strong>C. COMPETITION WITH A GROUP COMPANY</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Latteys-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2340" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Latteys-3.jpg" alt="Latteys group company" width="652" height="262" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Latteys-3.jpg 652w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Latteys-3-300x121.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px" /></a></p>
<p>The promoters own another company, Lattice Engineering, that freely (no non-compete agreement, no assuaraces) competes with Latteys Industries.</p>
<p><strong>D. HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p>
<p>The issue is very tiny: 5.8 crore for retail, 5.8 cr for non-retail. Plus, it is being managed by Pantomath. It will easily sell through.sail through</p>
<p>The promoters hold 73% post issue. Their cost is roughly about 6.20 bucks per share which is okay as SME owners&#8217; reward is by discovering the true demand of their stock through an IPO.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<h3>Given the small size and the fact that it is managed by Pantomath, the stock should see listing gains. From there on, performance counts.</h3>
<h3>Nevertheless, if you can call the company and check whether its aggressive inventory buildup as on 30-9-17 translated into sales, it would be helpful.</h3>
