<p>In the near future, all things that are useful to humans will be connected by Internet. For example, appliances, cars, etc. It will be possible for humans to control most of these Internet-enabled things with their smartphones (after installing the manufacturer&#8217;s app). The software program of the app will be hosted on a cloud server.</p>
<p>Now, think of your mobile phone as a remote control. You will be able to command the enabled things using your mobile. For example, you can keep something on the electric stove in the morning, and then use your app and command the appliance to heat it just before reaching home. All communication will move over 5G Spectrum (well, mostly).</p>
<p>Now, this example is good as far as your personal use goes.</p>
<p>There are other things of public utility that will be fitted with IoT hardware, in particular in smart cities, for example:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h6>Fire alarms</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Intelligent lighting</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Vehicle speed checkers</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Soil monitoring equipment (for agriculture or for preventing landslides, etc.)</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Water tanks and pipes, to detect leakages</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Smartphones, for various purposes such as facial recognition, wifi detection, etc.</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Water tanks, for monitoring water potability</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Earthquake measuring equipment</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>In Electric and AI-driven vehicles, for navigational, parking, etc.</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Waste management (for monitoring levels)</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Pollution measuring equipment</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Border monitoring (defence)</h6>
</li>
<li>
<h6>Green Buildings (maybe to measure CO2 levels, or degradation of green materials)</h6>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>The IoT Hardware</h2>
<p>There are 3 main hardware components &#8212; processors, communication modules that enable communication between different hardware components, and <strong>SENSORS</strong>.</p>
<p>Sensors are very important in the IoT ecosphere because it is only when the computer &#8220;senses&#8221; what it is programmed to sense, can the system communicate with the control centre.</p>
<p>In the future, sensors will be used in most electronic appliances, public utility assets and at other critical areas that need monitoring.</p>
<p>Therefore, it&#8217;s a no brainer that most efficiently-managed companies that  manufacture sensors will benefit.</p>
<h2>Listed Indian Companies That Manufacture Sensors or are Ready For IoT</h2>
<p><strong>(thanks to many of my Twitter pals who helped me make this list)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Siemens</strong> &#8211; a must-have in your portfolio. It excels in all applications that will be needed to build our future.</p>
<p><strong>ABB</strong> &#8211; Another true blue stock, just like Siemens</p>
<p><strong>Schneider Electric </strong>&#8211; Superb German pedigree<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Sensomatic India</strong> &#8211; IoT ready for smart homes</p>
<p><strong>Minda corp</strong> &#8212; Makes sensors for 2,3 and 4 wheelers</p>
<p><strong>Honeywell</strong> &#8211; Another true blue chip</p>
<p><strong>Bosch</strong> &#8211; Another royal blue.</p>
<p><strong>Pricol</strong> &#8211; makes speed, temperature and oxygen sensors, and may even add to its portfolio going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Centum Electronics</strong> &#8212; very high end microwave electronics manufacture and design. Am unsure how it will apply to IoT.</p>
<p><strong>Shivalik Bimetals</strong> &#8211; I think this company can manufacture sensors for EV batteries and appliances, but have to check with them.</p>
<p><strong>Moschip Semiconductor</strong> &#8211; Superb turnaround company into high end computing and utility hardware</p>
<p>These are all for now. Will research some more and add new <strong>IoT hardware</strong> companies if and when.</p>
<p>Feel free to drop in your suggestions. Thanks.</p>
