<p>Typically, a support point represents a price at which buyers will or should buy the stock and the resistance point is when sellers will dump the stock.</p>
<p>The idea being that if a trader or investor knows the support and resistance levels, he can enter into profitable trades or book his profits or SLs.</p>
<p>There are two general rules of Support and Resistance:</p>
<p>FOR BUYERS: A stock falling to an old low is worse than a stock falling down to its old high.</p>
<p>FOR SELLERS: A stock piercing above its old prior is better than when it pierces above its old low.</p>
<p>Though you cannot time the market, learning how to tell the support and resistance levels can help you get the timing almost-right.</p>
<h3>Here&#8217;s how you discover support and resistance levels.</h3>
<p><strong>A. By Marking Highs and Lows</strong></p>
<p>In the chart above I have marked the major lows (9360, 9460, 9720, 10021, 10300 and 9956) and the highs (10135, 10470 and the all time high of 11200).</p>
<p>These are the support and resistance levels in this example. As you can see, the support of 28/9/17 of 9720 has held out so far, and even the support of 10021 was breached, and there was an immediate bounce back.</p>
<p>As far as highs are concerned, when the two highs of 10136 and 10470 were pierced, the NIFTY hit a high of 11200.</p>
<p>Currently the NIFTY is at 10618 above its resistance of 10470. So, if it falls below 10470, then the low of 10300 can hold as the support. And so on. Keep watching the levels to learn the concept.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SR1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2238" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SR1.jpg" alt="how to determine support and resistance levels" width="1348" height="638" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SR1.jpg 1348w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SR1-300x142.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SR1-768x363.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SR1-1024x485.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1348px) 100vw, 1348px" /></a></p>
<p>Now, I have created an example for a 1-day period chart.</p>
<p>Traders and swing traders should determine support and resistance levels after studying 30-minute, 1-hour and 4-hour period charts.</p>
<p>Investors  should determine support and resistance levels after studying 1-hour, 1-day and 1-Month period charts.</p>
<p><strong>B. By Plotting Moving Averages</strong></p>
<p>In the example below, I have plotted 4 Moving Averages on a 1-Day Period Chart</p>
<p>9-Day &#8211; <strong>10,648</strong></p>
<p>20-Day &#8211; <strong>10,551</strong></p>
<p>50-Day &#8211; <strong>10,393</strong></p>
<p>200-Day &#8211; <strong>10,283</strong></p>
<p>Nifty is at <strong>10,618</strong></p>
<p>It has crossed below the 9-Day MA but is still some distance away from the 20-Day MA. If it falls blow 10551, the next supports are at 10,393 and 10,283.</p>
<p>If it falls below 10,283, and keeps falling,, then there could be real trouble and the next support will be at 10,021 (see section A above).</p>

<p><strong>If you are a trader you should check MAs for support and resistance on 30-minute, 1-hour and 4-hour charts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A swing trader should check MAs for support and resistance on 1-Hour, 4-hour, and 1-day charts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Short and medium term traders can work with 1-day and Weekly charts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Long term traders should check Weekly and Month charts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>C. Trendlines</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/dev/charts/how-to-draw-a-trendline-a-step-by-step-guide/">Before reading any further, learn how to draw trendlines here</a>.</p>
<p>Assuming you have read the article, you now know that that if a stock falls below the trendline, it has entered a bear zone, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Addition information:</p>
<p><strong>If you are a trader draw trendines on 30-minute charts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are a swing trader draw trendines on 30-minute charts 1-Hour charts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are a medium term trader draw trendines on 1-day charts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are a long term trader draw trendines on 1-week charts.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, these are my recommendations and you can chop and play around with periods that you are comfortable with.</p>
<p>This is how you can easily determine support and resistance levels.</p>
