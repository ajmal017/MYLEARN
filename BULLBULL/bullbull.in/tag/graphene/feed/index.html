<p><strong>You may feel that the lithium ion batteries that will soon be fitted into EVs are the best thing to happen to happen to the automobile sector.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You may feel that the current crop of LED lights are cheapest and the best in the world.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Well, forget about what you feel. All these assumptions will soon become burnt toast.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h2>All because of a new wonder material that is thin, lightweight, flexible but harder than a diamond, 200 times stronger than steel, and a super conductor of electricity.</h2>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><strong>BUT IT&#8217;S A MILLION TIMES THINNER THAN PAPER!</strong></span></p>
<p>This new material will soon be used across all industries &#8211; in particular, <strong>electric Vehicles, electronic devices, computers, Healthcare, desalination, smartphones, defence and AI applications</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>It can make your computer (and other appliances) work 1,000 times faster and more efficiently than what the latest tech available can achieve.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It allows water to filter through and therefore it will be used in water filtration and desalination applications.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It can very efficiently store energy and therefore will be used in batteries, especially EV batteries.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And, hold your breath: When combined with carbon fibre (another super material), it results in a more stronger and lightweight material that holds phenomenal hope for the defence industry (lighter but stronger vehicles, weapons and wearables)</span></p>
<h2>What the hell is this material?</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s called <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>GRAPHENE</strong></span>.</p>
<h2>How is Graphene Made?</h2>
<p>Graphene is a one-atom thick layer of GRAPHITE.</p>
<p>Graphite is derived from CARBON.</p>
<h2><strong>Which Indian Companies Will Benefit From The Graphene Boom?</strong></h2>
<p>Just don&#8217;t jump into any stock now. Remember that graphene is expensive to make and it will take a few years for its technology to become cost-efficient. But these stocks will do great over time (long-term).</p>
<p><strong>Reliance</strong>: Is about to buy Kemrock&#8217;s assets. This will help it manufacture carbon fibre (not graphene).</p>
<p><strong>Tata Steel</strong> too will soon commercialize Graphene production. (Contributed by <a class="account-group js-account-group js-action-profile js-user-profile-link js-nav" href="https://twitter.com/miningmeme" data-user-id="854731930096422912"><span class="username u-dir" dir="ltr" data-aria-label-part="">@<b>miningmeme</b></span></a> )</p>
<p><strong>Rain Industries</strong>: Into carbon, the basic raw material of graphene.</p>
<p><strong>Himadri Specialty Chemicals</strong>: Into carbon</p>
<p><strong>BASF</strong>: Into a wide range of chemicals and can engineer newer and futuristic materials.</p>
<p><strong>Goa Carbon</strong>: Into carbon</p>
<p><strong>Panasonic Carbon Company India</strong>: Makes carbon rods and looks very good (low PE and all). This company has phenomenal potential because it supplies carbon rods to Panasonic factories across the world.</p>
<p>BUT the stock is an underperformer. So, you need to track it.</p>
<p><strong>Phillips Carbon Black</strong>: But this is more for rubber and general applications than EVs. It&#8217;s run up 400% this year anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Graphite India</strong>: Solid stock but appreciated 300% last 12 months.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now. Feel free to suggest your picks (with your Twitter ID) and I&#8217;ll be happy to publish them and get you some exposure too. Thanks.</p>
