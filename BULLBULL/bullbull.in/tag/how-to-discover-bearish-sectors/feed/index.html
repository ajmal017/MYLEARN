<p>Sector stock analysis helps investors learn about the type of stocks that operators and other biggies are accumulating. The accumulation by the biggies can be anything &#8211; better financial condition for the companies going ahead (long term prospects) or for the for a quick short term trade.</p>
<p>Whatever reason it may be, sectoral analysis helps investors judge how well stocks in the different sectors will perform in the near-long term.</p>
<p>The analysis would be even sharper and trades more profitable if the data was available live, and based on micro sectors.</p>
<p>Well, you&#8217;re in luck, because there is a website that breaks down sectors into micro sectors and helps in your quest.</p>
<p>For example, if the two wheeler segment in the auto sector is trending up, it helps you latch on to two wheeler stocks, and so on.</p>
<p>Before I discuss this website, know that many folks who analyze sectors often refer to sites that give the macro picture.</p>
<p>For example, what use is information that the auto sector is trending up when the sector is up because only 2 wheelers are in an uptrend?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you will agree that analyzing micro sectoral data than analyzing the macro data.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.bseindia.com/markets/Equity/EQReports/industrywatchList.aspx">There is only one website that displays this helpful information &#8211; and it is the BSE.</a></h2>
<p>You also can drill down into any micro sector and figure out the stocks that are performing and separate these from the duds.</p>
<h3>Best of all, it allows analyze information of 111 micro sectors spread over 4 pages!</h3>
