<br />
79 paise EPS for 2016-17.<br />
<br />
Company's products are exported as well and its export revenue is 55% of total revenue.<br />
<br />
Company has 2 plants, 1 in Sonepat and another in Noida.<br />
<br />
The company has repaid all its short term borrowings and the long term debt is just 50.70 lakhs.<br />
<br />
Capital is 6.89 crores, cash flows from operations are healthy, debtor cycle is 45 days. and promoters hold 55% of the capital.<br />
<br />
The company also will benefit from EV orders.<br />
<br />
This stock in my opinion should return 60% in a year.</td>

<br />
1. Company has 2 large oil processing units - 1 in Haldia (bengal) and another in Satidham (Gujrat)<br />
<br />
2. The Gujrat unit is spun off to its subsidiary, Gokul Agri Exports<br />
<br />
3. The Haldia unit is sold off to Adani group for 278 crores, which is a decent valuation considering the fixed assets of the company cost 162 crores. The capital is just 26 crores, so this sale may be a bonanza for shareholders.<br />
<br />
4. The company also has set up edible oil trading firms in Singapore and Mauritius.<br />
<br />
5. Another subsidiary has tied up with GMDC for mining lignite for power generation.<br />
<br />
6. Consolidated EPS  for the previous year was about 1.1 mainly because the Haldia unit was cost intensive.<br />
<br />
7. The company has revoked its pledged shares a few days ago, which kind of indicates that Adani may have paid up the sale consideration.<br />
<br />
I see fabulous times ahead for this low priced stock.<br />

Has recently tied up with Accor of France, which is now managing the hotel (now renamed as Grand Mercure Surya Palace). Last year's EPS was poor because the company spent on refurbishing rooms to Accor's taste. Copanyhas refinanced a loan from HDFC at a rate that is lower by 3% than what it is paying. Owners hold 58% of share capital and are reducing debt. This company has paid dividends consistently and seems headed for greater heights because the new GST laws (rooms below 7500 to benefit) will help boost its profitability. The company also has started a spa in the hotel premises which is also open to public members. </td>

<tr class="row-5 odd">
	<td class="column-1">14-10-17</td><td class="column-2">Gujarat Intrux</td><td class="column-3">76</td><td class="column-4">I'd rate this a clear 4/5.. almost-Gem</td><td class="column-5">Gujarat based mould maker. Uses the conventional and economical sand casting process. promoters own a company that is into investment casting, so can ramp up synergies quickly.<br />
<br />
Though its sales have suffered because of the appreciating $ and falling investments in the hydrocarbon sector because of low oil prices, it is now set to see better days because oil has started rising. <br />
<br />
Oil investments make an impact on the bottomline because the company makes valves and castings mainly for companies in the hydrocarbon sector. Cross country water pipeline valve and equipment orders are also expected to pour in.<br />
<br />
The company has optimized on costs and delivers reasonable profitability even when sales are falling.<br />
<br />
Low capital 3.96 crores (34 crore reserves), low floating stock, and perhaps an eps of Rs 4 this year will take this stock to new highs.<br />
<br />
Plus, their balance sheet has a capital work in progress item, which should bloom soon.<br />

	<td class="column-1">8-10-17</td><td class="column-2">Orient Abrasives</td><td class="column-3">34</td><td class="column-4">Between gem and stone</td><td class="column-5">Belongs to the Ashapura Mines group. <br />
<br />
Owns mines from which it extracts minerals to manufacture  alumina raw materials and refractory minerals.<br />
<br />
EPS is low at 58 paise for 16-17, but future seems bright because alumina will enjoy a high demand going forward.</td>

<br />
Their Surya Salt is popular in Rajasthan. It's group company which is into spices is trading around 75.<br />
<br />
The company incurred a loss of 58 lakhs in 2016-17 but the good thing was that it was because of depreciation. Still, a cause for concern.<br />
<br />
The company has operationalized a hotel in the Fort Auwa, is setting up a spa resort in Jaipur, and a hotel on Jaipur-Delhi road is on the cards.<br />
<br />
The stock price has been a laggard for many years now, but in my opinion, it has potential to return 50% in 6-12 months.<br />
<br />
FV 10, BV is 11.30.</td>

	<td class="column-1">11-9-17</td><td class="column-2">Alufluoride</td><td class="column-3">69.90</td><td class="column-4">Almost-gem, getting polished. Rating 3.75/5.</td><td class="column-5">Superb waste-to-wealth stock that aids in the manufacture of aluminum.<br />
<br />
It takes (aluminum hydroxide) waste from aluminum and waste (fluosilicic acid) from fertilizer plant , and processes both to  manufacture aluminum fluoride, which is then again used by aluminum manufacturers.<br />
<br />
Aluminum is a red hot metal that will do great as the world gets ready for EVs and lighter metal applications.<br />
<br />
A low equity base, a decent EPS of 3.60 for 2016-17, a relatively low PE of 16, talks of an expansion, and the prospects of the aluminum business can combine to make this a multibagger.<br />
<br />
It's appreciated 300% in the last 12 months but still has a lot of way to go in my opinion.<br />
<br />

1. Stock Broking (on upswing)<br />
<br />
2. Physical commodity trading and import-export (almonds, cashews, pulses, etc.) (also on upswing)<br />
<br />
3. Commodity retail (mainly almonds)<br />
<br />
4. Real estate<br />
<br />
The company is now consolidating and demerging its business into 2 entities - financial and commodities retail/trade.<br />
<br />
Existing shareholders will get shares of both companies.<br />
<br />
Low equity of 5.29 cr, FV 1, but a low EPS of 33 paise. This stock can be considered for investment.</td>

4. Mobiles<br />
<br />
5. Food (Yogurt)<br />
<br />
6. Indian Poker League, which has the potential to take off as card playing sports become popular<br />

This is an emerging stock and all investment is based on hope and optimism, not on past performance. <br />

Read up on them and make your judgment. </td>

I'd rate it 2.5/5 and the ONLY reason for that is because the share was quoting 4 bucks in 2015.</td><td class="column-5">Seems like a good stock with lots of potential. Their corrugated packaging biz will do well as ecommerce and warehousing activity picks up.<br />
<br />
They are also into metal containers, RPP closures, aluminum foils, printing inks, and more. <br />
<br />
Small equity of 6.55 crores, FV 1, EPS of 1 (low). <br />
<br />
Negative is that their profits are not consistent Q on Q and the price has appreciated like crazy over 2 years. <br />
The company plans to open facilities in other countries and the stock holds promise, though it is overvalued.</td>

	<td class="column-1">4-9-17</td><td class="column-2">Pudumjee Paper Products</td><td class="column-3">28.70</td><td class="column-4">More of a gem than a stone, I'd rate it at 3.75/5</td><td class="column-5">The company's focus on specialty paper (security, cheque, hygiene tissues, food, pharma, etc., will ensure that the company's sales will not dive as digitization seeps in.<br />
<br />
The company also manufactures hygiene products for personal and institutional consumption. Their brand, Greenlime, is catching up quickly.<br />
<br />
Low equity of 9.5 cr, (FV 1), EPS of 2.10, above average management quality, and a high promoter holding of approx 67% make this stock a compelling buy.<br />
