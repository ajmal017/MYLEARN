<p>CCI works like the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) and warns traders when prices reach extreme zones. Its twists and turns can also be used to enter or exit from trades.</p>
<h2>How Is The Commodity Channel Index Calculated?</h2>
<div class="level2">
<p>Well, there&#8217;s much more than understanding the formula of calculating the CCI, which anyway is:</p>
</div>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cci.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2129" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cci.jpg" alt="Commodity Channel Index Calculation" width="412" height="101" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cci.jpg 412w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cci-300x74.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px" /></a></p>
<p>Well, the formula is set, and by the Commodity Channel Index period is by default set to 20. (Twenty being the periods. For example, if a chart is made up of 15 minute candles, then twenty 15-minute candle prices are used to calculated averages).</p>
<h2>Before that, know that most of the CCI movements happen between -100 and +100. Moves that exceed this channel depict extraordinary strength or weakness that can be herald forthcoming price action.</h2>
<p>AN Extremely high level indicates the stock is <strong>OVERBOUGHT</strong> while an extremely low level indicates the stock is <strong>OVERSOLD</strong>.</p>
<h2>When CCI is between the -100 and +100 range it can be interpreted as bullish when it is positive, and bearish when it is negative.</h2>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What you must know is how to calculate this default period, and whether 20 is applicable to your trading setup.</span></h2>
<p>Here is an example of VIP Industries.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s first see what the 20-Period CCI of VIP Industries tells us:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cci1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2130" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cci1.jpg" alt="how to analyze Commodity Channel Index" width="1361" height="632" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cci1.jpg 1361w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cci1-300x139.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cci1-768x357.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cci1-1024x476.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1361px) 100vw, 1361px" /></a></p>
<p>The CCI in this case has moved way beyond +100 and is kissing 274, which somehow does give the impression that it may be overbought.</p>
<p><strong>HOWEVER, THERE IS A RECENT EVENT THAT HAS OCCURRED IN VIP INDUSTRIES</strong></p>
<p>The management has started picking up fairly large quantities of the stock over the last two weeks.</p>
<p>Note that in such an event-based price action, the 20-period configuration does not hold good.</p>
<p>Here is what you do:</p>
<p>(a) Take 2 recent highs around the time of the event<br />
(b) Calculated the time period between these two highs<br />
(c) Divide the time period by 3</p>
<p>In the case of VIP industries, as you will observe in the weekly chart below, the price started spurting a week before the management got into the act.</p>
<p>Therefore, the stock has seen 2 highs <strong>AFTER THE EVENT</strong> (insider buying) within the span of 3 weekly candles. So, 3 weeks are 21 days. Divide it by 3 and you get 7.</p>
<p>As the event is recent, I have shortened the period to 6. Now here is the chart:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CC2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2132" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CC2.jpg" alt="commodity channel index period " width="1366" height="626" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CC2.jpg 1366w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CC2-300x137.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CC2-768x352.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CC2-1024x469.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px" /></a></p>
<p>CCI 20 is at 273 while CCI 6 is at 127, which is a huge variance. The 20-period CCI suggests the stock is overbought while the 6-period CCI suggests that the stock is witnessing extraordinary bullish fervor.</p>
<p>THIS IS WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO ADJUST THE CCI PERIOD  for stocks that ave been impacted by events.</p>
<p>ALWAYS, take the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1-year period chart</strong> </span>of any stock into consideration, check for events of the past one year and see how the prices behave, and then:</p>
<p>1. Take 2 highs or lows (in the case of bearish news, and in case you want to short the stock)<br />
2. Calculate the time period between the two highs or lows<br />
3. Divide by 3<br />
4. Apply that period to the CCI.<br />
5. If the stock has no memorable events associated to it, you can use the default CCI period (20).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all you need to know. If you have questions, please fire away.</p>
