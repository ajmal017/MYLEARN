<p>A bull call spread is a low risk spread that consists of two calls (CEs) that expire on the same date but have different strike prices.</p>
<p>You have to short one call one strike price and buy another call at the at lower strike price.</p>
<p>YOU SHOULD PLAY THIS ONLY WHEN THE TREND ISÂ <strong>BULLISH</strong> &#8211; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000080;"><strong>and you are happy with moderate gains</strong></span>.</p>
<h3>How To Play The Bull Call Spread (Example)</h3>
<p>Nifty is at 10750 as on 2 May 2018.</p>
<p>Let us assume you are bullish on the market and feel that Nifty can hit 10900 by end-May. But knowing that markets are uncertain, you would not like to buy a naked (one side) option.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s what you can do:</p>
<p>BUY 10750 CE at 135 (1 lot = 75 units)</p>
<p>SELL 10800 CE at 110 (1 lot = 75 units)</p>
<p>If Nifty hits 10900 by 31 May 2018, you will gain Rs 50* X 75 = 3,750 [<span style="color: #ff0000;">Less</span>] the square off cost** of Rs 1,875 on your short call (as per the calculation below) = Net gain Rs 1,875</p>
<p>(*You will <span style="color: #003300;"><strong>make</strong> </span>Rs 150 per unit on your 10750CE and lose Rs 100 per unit on the 10800CE you sold).</p>
<p>**If Nifty does not move as per your expectations, you will end up <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>losing</strong> </span>Rs 25 per unit (135 &#8211; 110) X 75 = 1,875.</p>
<p>Either way your gains and losses are capped.</p>
<h3>You should enter into this trade only when the prices are steady or in a bull trend. This strategy is ideal for folks who are averse to risk-taking and are content with small profits (or losses).</h3>
<h3>When To Play The Bull Call Spread</h3>
<ol>
<li>When you are 60%-70% certain that the market will rise before the expiry date.</li>
<li>When you expect good news over the weekend.</li>
<li>During results period, when you are, say, more than 50% sure of a positive outcome.</li>
<li>#3 can be extended to events as well based on forthcoming corporate meetings.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Caution</strong></h3>
<p>Square up both the calls at the same time. It is extremely dangerous to leave a short call open in a volatile market.</p>
<p>However, if you are dead certain that the market will move higher, then you can cover the short call and hold on to the long one. But know that if things don&#8217;t work out your loss will increase but will be limited to the cost you incurred (135) for the call.</p>
<p>It is however recommended that you close out both options on the same day preferably around the same time. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Never leave a short option open &#8211; if markets turn, you will end up paying through your nose.</strong></span></p>
<p>Remember that as time passes and the expiration comes closer, the time value of options erode rapidly. Therefore you must book your profits or losses ahead of expiry.</p>
