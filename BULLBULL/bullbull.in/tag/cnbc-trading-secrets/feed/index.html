<p><strong>12th July, CNBC Hindi</strong>: Ashish Kukreja, a market expert, recommends Chartered Logistics at 20.80. He delivers a bullish commentary.</p>
<p>Watch his video here.</p>

<p><strong>13th July</strong>: Chartered Logistics opens strong at 20.85 and jumps to 24 on strong volumes.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-410 size-full" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Chartered-Logistics-Chart.jpg" alt="Buy Chartered Logistics " width="667" height="447" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Chartered-Logistics-Chart.jpg 667w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Chartered-Logistics-Chart-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p><strong>13 July, Corporate Announcements</strong>: Chartered Logistics <a href="http://www.bseindia.com/stock-share-price/chartered-logistics-ltd/chlogist/531977/#">discloses to the stock exchange/s that Mr Harsh Gandhi, their Executive Director, would be appearing on CNBC TV 18</a>.</p>
<p><strong>13 July, CNBC TV 18:</strong>Â Nigel D&#8217;souza interviews Mr Harsh Gandhi of Chartered Logistics, who engages in a bullish commentary about the company. Stock spurts from 23.25 to 24, a 3+% jump. It closes at 24.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/disruption-in-market-post-gst-pressurising-logistics-companies-chartered-logistics-2324975.html">Watch that video here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>13 July, Corporate Announcements</strong>: Chartered Logistics <a href="http://www.bseindia.com/stock-share-price/chartered-logistics-ltd/chlogist/531977/#">discloses to the stock exchange/s that ONGC has awarded 24-crore order which is to be executed in 2 years</a>.</p>
<p>Too many coincidences.</p>
<h3>Analysis of this Chartered Logistics Episode</h3>
<ol>
<li>Is it possible that this whole episode was coordinated? That is, recommend on Hindi channel during off market hours on one day and interview the management the next day on the English channel?</li>
<li>If this was unconnected, it implies that the guys at CNBC Hindi and English channels do not coordinate news and interviews.</li>
<li>Is it possible that the recommending analyst, Chartered Logistics, and their PR firm are engaged in an effort to jack up stock prices? Remember that as per my information, PR firms are well connected to TV channels and they arrange interviews for their clients.</li>
<li>If Chartered Logistics management informed the stock exchanges of the CNBC TV18 interview on 13 July, isn&#8217;t it obvious that the interview was fixed a few days earlier?</li>
<li>Does not (4) above imply that the sequence of events tie up and look like a coordinated action?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To Conclude</strong></p>
<p>The good thing about this whole thing is that Chartered Logistics is an okay kind of stock that reported an EPS of 1.4 for the year ended March 2017.</p>
<p>It will surely benefit from GST and its future will depend on how well it is managed.</p>
<p>One thing I&#8217;d advice you folks to do is:</p>
<p>Watch any one CNBC channel (Hindi or English) during market hours and the other during off market hours when stocks are being recommended. If what I have written above turns out to be a pattern, you can help yourself to many winners.</p>
