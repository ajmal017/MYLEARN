Should you invest? Read on to find out.</p>
<p>All information is analyzed from the company&#8217;s Red Herring prospectus:</p>
<p>The company is into designing, engineering, fabrication and installation of façade systems. A facade is the face of a building or its interiors (walls, doors, skylights, glass, canopies, etc.). It makes a building and its interiors appear visually attractive. Moreover, green buildings need to engineer their facades well, so the market is growing.</p>
<p>Innovative Facades owns a factory in Wada, Maharashtra (125000 sft), where facades are made on machines with workers performing manual tasks (the prospectus says the process is not automated). Clients include Hiranandani Realtors, Relcon Infraprojects, Larsen &amp; Toubro,  Grauer &amp; Weil, etc.</p>
<p>The funds raised by the IPO will be used to upgrade the manufacturing facility (10 crores), meet working capital requirements (20 crores).</p>
<p><strong>As per the company&#8217;s sources, it is sitting on an order book of 250 crores. The market size is 20,000 crores and the company is a niche player in the field having constructed facades for many iconic structures in Mumbai.</strong> <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>All these are big positives.</strong></span></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start the analysis:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IFS1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2218" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IFS1.jpg" alt="Innovators Facade System IPO" width="662" height="272" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IFS1.jpg 662w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IFS1-300x123.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>ONE</strong>: The company&#8217;s auditors have qualified their 2016 and 2017 report on the following counts:<br />
a. Weak governance policies<br />
b. Loose controls over financial reporting<br />
c. Statutory dues not deposited with the authorities (IT payable to the tune of about 5 crores, currently being disputed)</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Such qualifications do not speak well about corporate governance</strong></span>.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IFS5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2231" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IFS5.jpg" alt="Innovators Facades IPO" width="621" height="304" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IFS5.jpg 621w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IFS5-300x147.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>TWO</strong>: The company has filed suits worth Rs 7 crores and third parties have sued the company and its subsidiaries for Rs 9.6 crores. The company sources have clarified that the litigation is mostly tax-related, and in the usual course of business.</p>
<p><strong>THREE</strong>: One of the promoters Jolly Multitrade. has no experience in the company&#8217;s line of business. The experienced promoter holds 12% while the non-experienced one holds 37% of pre-issue capital.</p>
<p>Jolly Multitrade had granted an unsecured loan to the company and it is this loan that was converted to equity shares at 35 per share. That&#8217;s how Jolly Multitrade got to become a promoter. Check this screenshot. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Also, know that the company&#8217;s sources have clarified that Jolly Multitrade belongs to the relatives of the main promoter and the whole family is in the same business</span></strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IFS3-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2224" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IFS3-1.jpg" alt="innovators facades ipo jolly multitrade" width="633" height="145" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IFS3-1.jpg 633w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IFS3-1-300x69.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>FOUR</strong>: The promoters own other companies that are in the same line of business, and the prospectus (page 32) clearly states that the promoters may favor a group company when it comes to bagging contracts. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>This can be a negative</strong></span>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IFS6.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2232" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IFS6.jpg" alt="Innovators facade IPO" width="685" height="186" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IFS6.jpg 685w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IFS6-300x81.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>FIVE:</strong>  The total borrowings are huge &#8211; 31.70 crores short term and 31.30 crores long term totaling to 63 crores on a pre-issue capital of 10.28 crores. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>That&#8217;s a debt equity of 6. </strong></span></p>
<p><strong>However, I have news from company sources that the unsecured loans granted by the promoters to the company do not carry any interest. One of the biggest bugbear in the facade industry is the massive requirement of working capital. </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>A huge positive is that the promoters will convert 10 crores from unsecured debt to equity at 72 per share. This is good because it shows the confidence of the investors in the company.</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ifs7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2233" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ifs7.jpg" alt="INNOVATORS FACADE ipo review" width="613" height="563" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ifs7.jpg 613w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ifs7-300x276.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>SEVEN:</strong>  Sales for the period ended 31-12-17 are 126 crores. Of these 45 crores are locked up in debtors, implying a credit period of around 4 months. It&#8217;s a little high but then the market is down, so it can be disregarded. However of these about 34 crores were outstanding for more than 6 months.  The company&#8217;s pre-tax net profit for the same period is 8.7 crores and the net increase in inventories is 14.7 crores.</p>
<p><strong>EIGHT:</strong>  The company typically reports a net profit (pre tax) of about 2-3% of sales for the last 2 years (2015-16 and 1026-17). However, for the period ended 31-12-17, the net profit before tax has shot up to 7%.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ifS8.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2234" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ifS8.jpg" alt="iNNOVATORS FACADE PROFIT MARGINS" width="601" height="720" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ifS8.jpg 601w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ifS8-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>NINE:</strong> <strong><span style="color: #008000;">Now, here&#8217;s one massive positive. Vijay Kedia has picked up 11 lakh equity shares at Rs 62 PLUS he is participating in the anchor book. </span></strong> I&#8217;ve checked with the company&#8217;s sources and the Vijay Kedia is the same cult investor we all know. If he is pumping money in the pre issue capital and participating in the anchor book, there&#8217;s got to be something in it.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IFS4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2226" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IFS4.jpg" alt="innovative facades sme ipo review" width="628" height="175" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IFS4.jpg 628w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IFS4-300x84.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>TEN</strong>: The company&#8217;s EPS has jumped from 2.16 (weighted average of past years) to 5.60 for 9 months ending 31-12-17. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Seems inconsistent</strong></span>. The company sources mentioned it was a tax issue, but I&#8217;m letting this comment be.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong>: Vijay Kedia has invested in the company, and there&#8217;s little doubt the issue will sail through and also appreciate on listing.</p>
<p>Should you invest in the issue? If your investment is based on the confidence of cult investors like Vijay Kedia and Varinder Bansal (Pantomath), the answer would be yes.</p>
<p>Without the Vijay Kedia and Pantomath factors, the finances of the company would look something like this:</p>
<p>Post issue capital = 13.21 crores + 5.66 crores = 18.87 crores<br />
Sales (December 2017 figures annualized) = 168 crores<br />
Net profit after tax (December 2017 profit annualized) =  11.6 crores<br />
EPS projected = 6 approx that<br />
PE = 12</p>
<p>Based on the conversation I&#8217;ve had with the company&#8217;s sources, and subject to the spike in profitability % that has been noted above, I feel that the stock price will appreciate on listing. To what extent can&#8217;t be said, but after clarifications there seems to be money on the table for retail investors.</p>
