<p>Think about what&#8217;s happening to PC Jewellers now and what happened to Fortis a while back when it crashed from 200+ to 110. These are the stocks for which the Long Strangle can work wonders.</p>
<p>You also can maximize gains if you can intelligently anticipate which way the stock will move. However, even if you cannot anticipate the movement, then this strategy will yield limited profits or losses (mostly profits).</p>
<h3><strong>How To Play The Long Strangle Strategy</strong></h3>
<p>The strategy involves buying</p>
<p>(a) an out-of-the money call option</p>
<p>(b) an out-of-the-money put option</p>
<p>with the same expiration date.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with an example. Let&#8217;s identify the stock.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s 7 May 2018, and volatile stock that hits us smack in the face is <strong>PC Jewellers</strong>.</p>
<p>The CMP is 225.</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 200 PE is 12</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 250 CE is 16</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s buy one lot each.</p>
<p>1500 units in one lot, so the total investment works out to:</p>
<p>1500 X 12 = 18,000</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>1500 X 16 = 24,000</p>
<p>Total = RS 42,000</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The rates mentioned above were prevalent at around 11 AM.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It&#8217;s 11.35 AM now and the rates are</strong></span>:</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 200 PE is 10</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 250 CE is 20</p>
<p>If we book out now, our profits are:</p>
<p>1500 X 10 = 15,000</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>1500 X 20 = 30,000</p>
<p>Total = RS 45,000</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>There&#8217;s a straight profit of Rs 3,000 within 40 minutes</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s wait and watch some more.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It&#8217;s 2.10 PM now and the rates are</strong></span>:</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 200 PE is 9</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 250 CE is 23</p>
<p>If we book out now, our profits are:</p>
<p>1500 X 9 = 13,500</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>1500 X 23 = 34,500</p>
<p>Total = RS 48,000</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>There&#8217;s a straight profit of Rs 6,000 in 95 minutes</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s wait and watch some more, and set the cut off time to 3.00 PM to finish up the article.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It&#8217;s 3.00 PM now and the rates are</strong></span>:</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 200 PE is 8.50</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 250 CE is 22.50</p>
<p>If we book out now, our profits are:</p>
<p>1500 X 8.50 = 12,750</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>1500 X 22.50 = 33,750</p>
<p>Total = RS 46,000</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>There&#8217;s a straight profit of Rs 4,000</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s square up this mock trade and be happy with Rs 4,000 in the pocket.</p>
<p>UPDATE ON 8-5-18</p>
<p>If the position was carried over for a day, here is how the profits would have looked:</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 200 PE is 28</p>
<p>The 31-5-18 250 CE is 23</p>
<p>If we book out now, our profits are:</p>
<p>1500 X 28 = 42,000</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>1500 X 23 = 34,500</p>
<p>Total = RS 76,500</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>There&#8217;s a straight profit of Rs 34,500</strong></span>.</p>
<h3>Worst Case Scenario</h3>
<p>The worst case scenario in this case would have been P C Jewellers staying steady or moving 5 bucks either way during the day.</p>
<p>If it were steady, you would have lost the options brokerage, which would have been a 100 bucks here or there.</p>
<p>In the worst possible case (inconsistently steady movement) you would have max lost a buck either way and your losses would have been capped to Rs 3,000 (worst case).</p>
<h3>Anticipation</h3>
<p>In the book trade, I picked up out-of-money CE and PE that were 25 bucks away from the CMP.</p>
<p>Had I anticipated that the chance of PC Jewellers moving higher than greater than it moving lower, I would have picked up a cheaper PE (say at around 180 strike price) and maximized my gains.</p>
<h3>When to Enter Into A Long Strangle</h3>
<ol>
<li>In volatile stocks, at any time.</li>
<li>On or around results&#8217; day.</li>
<li>By monitoring company announcements and entering into a long strangle on the day of the meeting.</li>
<li>In any stock that is heavily in the news, for whatever reason, good or bad.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Caution</strong></h3>
<p>Square up both options at the same time, preferably in 1-2 days from the day of entering into the trade or when you feel that the volatility has fizzled out.</p>
<p><strong>Do not leave any call open.</strong></p>
<p>Remember that as time passes and the expiration comes closer, the time value of options erode rapidly. Therefore you must book your profits or losses quickly for this strategy. Don&#8217;t allow your option to rot</p>
<p>If you are new to options, create an Excel sheet and enter into mock trades. Play the real market only when you have sort of mastered options.</p>
