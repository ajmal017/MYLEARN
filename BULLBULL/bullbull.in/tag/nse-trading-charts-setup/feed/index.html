Let&#8217;s get started:</p>
<h3>GENERAL RULES</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/how-to-be-100-sure-of-a-chart-signal/">Traders MUST read this article before jumping into a trade</a></strong>. Know that once you know the big picture and the short term trend, you can use 15m and 30m candles to enter into a trade.</li>
<li>The VWAP generally equalizes with the CMP during the day, and that is the time a trader should act. If the price starts moving above the VWAP, it is bullish, and the VWAP will gradually move up to equalize with the price over the space of a few candles.</li>
<li>Investors should work with 1-hour or 1-Day charts. 1-Day charts can provide better medium term cues, while 1-hour charts provide the trend for a swing trade.</li>
<li>Use charts only for FNO stocks and Indices. Do not track illiquid stocks on charts because these can be manipulated easily.</li>
<li>This trade setup will give you about 2-3 trades on the Indices every week, and no more. For stocks, it is up to you as it depends on the number of stocks you are interested in.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>UNDERSTANDING CHART TIME FRAMES </strong></p>
<p>A trader or investor typically checks 3 time frames:</p>
<ol>
<li>ONE WEEK for understanding overall trend <em>(time period to check &#8211; 4-5 months)</em></li>
<li>ONE DAY for understanding short term trends <em>(time period to check &#8211; 5-6 weeks)</em></li>
<li>ONE HOUR for entering into trades <em>(time period to check &#8211; 3-4 weeks)</em></li>
</ol>
<h3>SETTING UP THE TRADE (Updated on 31-5-18)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Log in at Investing.com</li>
<li>Search for any symbol or index.</li>
<li>Set up the following indicators:<br />
a. <strong>SuperTrend</strong> (7, 3): It alerts you when the trend changes by plotting arrows on the chart.<br />
b. <strong>VWAP</strong> (Volume Weighted Average Price): Bullish when price moves above it, and bearish otherwise.<br />
c. <strong>Ichimoku Cloud</strong>: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://bullbull.in/charts/how-to-use-the-ichimoku-cloud/">Read this post to figure out how it works</a></span>.<br />
d. <b>MACD</b>: Earlier, I worked with the Chaikin Oscillator but have found that the MACD gives a more reliable signal. <strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/how-to-use-the-macd-indicator-for-spotting-momentum-and-trend/">Read this article to learn how the MACD should be interpreted</a></strong>.<br />
e. I have added 13-DAY and 48-DAY EMAs to the setup. When 13D EMA crosses the 48D EMA it is a bullish signal, and vice versa.<br />
f. Note that the images below do not contain MACD and the EMAs, but even without those, the setup works perfectly.</li>
</ol>
<h3>INTERPRETATION</h3>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Interpretation.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2112" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Interpretation.jpg" alt="technicals for beginners and intermediate traders" width="1349" height="634" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Interpretation.jpg 1349w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Interpretation-300x141.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Interpretation-768x361.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Interpretation-1024x481.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1349px) 100vw, 1349px" /></a></p>
<p>Check the numbers on the chart before reading this interpretation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Supertrend</strong> signaled a buy on 16-4-18 at 10488-10500 levels. At this point, the priced moved ferociously above the <strong>VWAP</strong>, another bullish signal. As you can observe, the <strong>VWAP</strong> (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the thick blue line</span>) moved up and equalized with the price after a few candles. Also, at this time the Ichimoku conversion line was above the base line, and the price moved above the conversion line, and so, we had a bullish trend confirmed by 3 signals, while the <strong>Chaikin Oscilltor</strong> suggested that money was moving out. However, the <strong>Chaikin Oscillator</strong> keeps evening out over a period of time, and as I recall, it was trending up when the other 3 signals suggested bullishness.</li>
<li>The Nifty hit a high of 10,552 and started dropping (see the big red candle).</li>
<li>Though the <strong>Supertrend</strong> indicator was still positive, the price started putting pressure on the <strong>VWAP</strong> and on the <strong>Ichimoku Conversion</strong> line (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the thin red line</span>) and that suggested that it was time to book profits and stay on the sidelines. The <strong>Chaikin Oscillator</strong> also indicated that money was dumping the Nifty (#5).</li>
<li>The support for the Nifty existed at 10506 (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the green <strong>Supertrend</strong> line</span>)  and 10460 (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the first <strong>Ichimoku</strong> cloud line</span>).</li>
<li>This is explained in #3 above.</li>
</ol>
<p>INTERPRETATION REVIEW</p>
<p>It is 11.45 AM now, and I am reviewing the interpretation written at 11 AM. Here is the chart:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iNTERPRETATION-REVIEW.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2113" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iNTERPRETATION-REVIEW.jpg" alt="how to interpret technical charts" width="1343" height="563" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iNTERPRETATION-REVIEW.jpg 1343w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iNTERPRETATION-REVIEW-300x126.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iNTERPRETATION-REVIEW-768x322.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iNTERPRETATION-REVIEW-1024x429.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1343px) 100vw, 1343px" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li>At 11.45 the scenario has played out as per the interpretation above. At this time, the <strong>Supertrend</strong> is still bullish. On the bearish side, the <strong>Chaikin Oscilltor</strong> has seen substantial volume selling, the prices are below the <strong>VWAP</strong> and  the <strong>Ichimoku Conversion Line</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Chaikin Oscillator</strong> also has flattened out and the last candle shows a rejection of selling. It&#8217;s 11.53 now and I see that the next candle is green, and the <strong>Chaikin Oscilltor</strong> has started rising. So at this point, I would wait to see how the price moves in relation to the VWAP and then make a decision. So, the strategy now is to sit on the sidelines and wait for a signal.</li>
<li>Know that the 1-day Nifty Candle chart is in bullish zone and therefore any shorts should not me taken home UNLESS the 1D Chart reverses.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>UPDATE ON 26 MAY 2018 AND 31 MAY 2018</strong></p>
<p>You can try out the following three indicators as well. After writing this article, I have tested these and can vouch for their effectiveness:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Supertrend</strong> (details above) (use it for entry)</li>
<li><strong>Ichimoku</strong> (use it for exits when it breaks Lead and Conversion Lines.</li>
<li><strong>MACD</strong> <a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/how-to-use-the-macd-indicator-for-spotting-momentum-and-trend/"><strong>Here is a MACD indicator guide</strong></a>.</li>
<li><strong>VWAP</strong> (explained above) &#8211; to learn how stock will trend.</li>
<li><strong>EMAs</strong> as explained above.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#8217;s it guys. Put this to use for both trading and investing, as suggested above. Good luck.</p>
