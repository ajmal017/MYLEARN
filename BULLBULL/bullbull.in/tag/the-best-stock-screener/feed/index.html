<p>It will help you discover trending stocks, analyze their charts and then enter into an intraday trade that can hold good for the very short term to up to 6 weeks.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start:</p>
<p><strong>A: SET UP A SCREENER</strong></p>
<p>I use <a href="https://chartink.com/screener/ema-golden-cross-1">Chartink</a>, but you can use any screener of your choice.</p>
<p>The criteria used is a variant of the Golden Cross that many traders follow.</p>
<p>The Screener I have set up triggers a call when the 13 Day EMA crosses above the 48 Day EMA.</p>
<p>Yes, it is a very simple screener because the thorough analysis is done on the charts.</p>
<p><strong>B. SIGNAL VALIDITY</strong></p>
<p>The signal holds good mostly for intraday trades but can work out for short term trades.</p>
<p>For example, I had tweeted about Godrej Consumer Products at 1103 a few days back and L&amp; T (1360)/Indian Hotels (141)/BSE (832) a day ago. All these stocks were discovered using this scanner along with <strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/market-iq/how-to-analyze-open-interest-data-and-generate-profitable-swing-trades/">reading OI data</a></strong>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Track Godrej Consumer Products tomorrow on the charts.. it is likely that it will break resistance if markets are steady or up. The chart is #3 out of 4 charts. <a href="https://t.co/OuIliLiEjp">pic.twitter.com/OuIliLiEjp</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Sunil Tinani (@TheBullBull) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBullBull/status/999310115969949697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Track L&amp;T, BSE, Indian Hotels on charts using our trade setup<a href="https://t.co/6j6csgqo1z">https://t.co/6j6csgqo1z</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Sunil Tinani (@TheBullBull) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBullBull/status/1000972292602511361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><strong>On 29-5-18</strong>: Godrej Consumer hit 1143 , L&amp;T jumped to 1420, Indian Hotels 148 and BSE continues to languish.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><strong>If you see profits intra day, you should book. If you are carrying your position forward, you must work with strict stop losses.</strong></span></p>
<p>Note that in some cases the signal can hold good even for the medium and long term, but that will hold true for 2 out of 10 stocks. Therefore, it is best to use it for intraday trades extending it to a short term trade only if you are 100% convinced.</p>
<p><strong>C. WHAT TIME TO START SCREENING</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can start at 9.20 to 9.30 AM to catch early trends.</strong></p>
<p>I scanned at 9.20 AM and got the following stocks:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2496" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery1.jpg" alt="how to pick stocks" width="958" height="254" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery1.jpg 958w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery1-300x80.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery1-768x204.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px" /></a></p>
<p>Out of the stocks screened, 4 were down and Remsons had hit the UC, leaving us with India Glycols.</p>
<p>I tweeted about the stock just to keep track:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Track (watch on charts or do a paper trade)</p>
<p>India Glycols</p>
<p>&mdash; Sunil Tinani (@TheBullBull) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBullBull/status/1001309975984001024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>At 9.30 AM I ran another scan and got the following trends:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2498" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery2.jpg" alt="how to discover trending stocks" width="955" height="219" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery2.jpg 955w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery2-300x69.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery2-768x176.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px" /></a></p>
<p>So at 9.30 AM, I now have 3 stocks to track:</p>
<p>India Glycols, Bodal Chemicals and to a lesser extent GHCL. This is because the volumes in GHCL are not significant enough.</p>
<p>Armed with this information let&#8217;s do a chart check:</p>
<p><strong>D. CHART CHECK</strong></p>
<p>We should do three checks:</p>
<p>One Hour &#8211; To determine if the stock is a buy</p>
<p>One Day &#8211; to determine the short term trend</p>
<p>One Week &#8211; to determine the overall trend</p>
<p>Now before you check the charts, <strong><a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/a-live-trade-setup-that-can-generate-super-profits/">please read this article</a> </strong>and set up the following indicators:</p>
<p>a. Supertrend<br />
b. Ichimoku<br />
c. MACD</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s analyze each pick per time period:</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2500" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery3.jpg" alt="how to read one hour charts" width="1346" height="659" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery3.jpg 1346w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery3-300x147.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery3-768x376.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery3-1024x501.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1346px) 100vw, 1346px" /></a></p>
<p>On the one hour charts, all three stocks are trending up and the ST has signaled a buy for all of them yesterday.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2501" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery4.jpg" alt="how to be a stock picker" width="1346" height="659" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery4.jpg 1346w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery4-300x147.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery4-768x376.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery4-1024x501.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1346px) 100vw, 1346px" /></a></p>
<p>On the one day charts, Bodal and GHCL are a clear buy. India Glycols is a sell but if you look at the MACD indicator, you will see that the MACD line is about to cross the Signal Line from below the Zero Line, which if it does, it will be an extremely bullish signal.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would not consider India Glycols to be in a bear grip. Now let&#8217;s move on t the weekly charts.</p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/charts/how-to-draw-a-trendline-a-step-by-step-guide/"><strong>You may want to read this article before analyzing the weekly period charts</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2502" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery5.jpg" alt="become an expert stock picker" width="1346" height="659" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery5.jpg 1346w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery5-300x147.jpg 300w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery5-768x376.jpg 768w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/discovery5-1024x501.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1346px) 100vw, 1346px" /></a></p>
<p>Since I can draw trendlines in my sleep, I don&#8217;t have to draw them here to know that all three stocks are in a medium-to-long-term uptrend. However you should draw trendlines for learning purposes.</p>
<p>So our chart analysis is good for all three stocks and</p>
<p><strong>E. RESULTS (AT 11.18 AM)</strong></p>
<p>Let us assume we took positions in all the three stocks at the rate we were alerted</p>
<p>The alert for INDIA GLYCOLS was generated at 533 (see image above). It touched 541 and is currently at 532.</p>
<p>The alert for BODAL was generated at 136.60 (see image above). It touched 140 and is currently at 136.90.</p>
<p>The alert for GHCL was generated at 282.55 (see image above). It touched 287 and is currently at 284.50.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #008000;"><strong>ALL THREE RESULTS GENERATED GAINS SO LONG PROFITS WERE BOOKED INTRA DAY!</strong></span></p>
<p>This is why I have suggested quick entries and exits and preferably booking intra day gains even though the stocks look good for a short term hold based on their daily and weekly charts.</p>
