Candlesticks are pretty comprehensive, and these cover the opening, closing, high and low prices.</p>
<p>The opening and closing is represented by a body that looks like a candle (hence the name) and the wicks (if any) on the candle represent the high and the low of the day.</p>
<p>The table below explains the concept of candlestick formation in detail.</p>
<p>After understanding candlesticks, you may want to check them out on charts.</p>
<p><strong>If you are a day trader, set the candlesticks period to 10, 15 or 30 minutes. If you are a BTST kind of guy, set it to 1 or 4 hours. If you are an investor set it to weekly-monthly.</strong></p>
<p>This is the first article in the series. The next set of articles will explain chart patterns (one article per chart pattern) and in those, you will be able to figure out how these formations play out. Stay tuned for those articles.</p>

<br />
A bullish candlestick implies that the closing price was higher than the opening price.<br />

The candlewicks that you see at the top or bottom are also referred to as shadows.<br />
<br />
Both the body (or the lack of it) and the shadows are extremely important to understand.</td>

<br />
In this example, the stock opened at 95, hit a high of 105. Sellers emerged at this rate and the stock closed at 100.<br />
<br />
Such candles can be interpreted as moderately bullish esp if they form after a spate of red candlesticks. </td>

<br />
In this example, the stock opened at 100 and bears hammered it down to 95. From there on, the bulls took charge and bought the stock, which closed at 105.<br />
<br />
This signifies bullish.</td>

<br />
A GREEN full bodied candlestick without any wicks is referred to as a Marubozu. <br />
<br />
In this example, the stock opened at 95 and closed at 105. The chargeup was relentless signifying huge buying interest. This candle signifies solid bullishness.</td>

<br />
In this example, the stock opened at 100, zoomed to 105 and then the hammering started dragging it all the way to 95. This is a bearish candle that suggests sellers are waiting to hammer down the stock or investors want to get rid of it for whatever reason.<br />

In this candle the stock opened at 105, fell to 95 and recovered to 100. THough this is a negative, it is not a majorly negative candle.<br />

<br />
The stock opened at 105, hit a low of 95 and then recovered to close at 105.<br />
<br />
This could be anything - short covering, reversal of trend (if it occurs when the share is continuously falling) or indecision.</td>

<br />
The stock opened at 95, saw a good amount of buying and touched 105. Then the sellers started dumping and it crashed back to 95.<br />

Long candle wicks or shadows are extremely important to understand. In this example, the stock opened at 95, hit 105 and closed at 98.<br />

This candlewick can be interpreted as a sign of indecision.<br />

<br />
The stock opened at 103 was bashed all the way down to 95 and it closed a little above the opening. <br />

<br />
Stock opened at 105 and was hammered down to 95. But it recovered well to close just below its opening price at 103.<br />
