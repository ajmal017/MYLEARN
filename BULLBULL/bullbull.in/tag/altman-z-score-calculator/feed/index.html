<p>Remember that nothing is sacrosanct and things keep changing over time.</p>
<p>The Financial Risk Calculator is based on Altman&#8217;s Z-Score.</p>
<p><strong>The score does not hold good for turnaround companies, and it may even represent a skewed picture for established companies.</strong></p>
<p>ALSO: This article is not valid for turnaround companies.</p>
<p>However, each line item of the Score has a story to tell, and here is how you should extrapolate one item with the other to interpret the story.</p>
<p><strong>1. WORKING CAPITAL TO TOTAL ASSETS</strong></p>
<p>A high working capital to assets ratio can actually be a negative because it can imply any of the following:</p>
<p>a. The management does not know how to deploy its cash.</p>
<p>b. The company holds excess and possibly obsolete inventory.</p>
<p>c. The company may have loads of bad debts that are reported in the receivables.</p>
<p>Also, a very low working capital to total assets ratio need not be a negative. It can imply that the company enjoys extended credit facilities from its suppliers.</p>
<p><strong>2. RESERVES &amp; SURPLUS TO TOTAL ASSETS</strong></p>
<p>When a company has low reserves, it can only expand or maybe even fulfill working capital requirements by borrowing more.</p>
<p>Sch companies can avoided because any disruption in the market or the entry of stronger competitors can destabilized business.</p>
<p><strong>3. EBIT To TOTAL ASSETS</strong></p>
<p>This is like the return on assets ratio. Think about it, if you have made a FD, you can easily make up to 7% in interest.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can ratio to figure out whether the company is returning a healthy return.</p>
<p>If the company&#8217;s rate of return on its assets is sub par or below its peers, you can junk it and switch over to a better stock.</p>
<p><strong>3. MARKET CAP To TOTAL LIABILITIES</strong></p>
<p>Let us understand the importance of this relationship with a real example: PC Jewellers</p>
<p>Market Cap of PC Jewellers is 7416 crores</p>
<p>Total Liabilities are 3790 crores</p>
<p>This gives us a ratio of 1.95 when PCJ is at 193.</p>
<p>When PC Jewellers fell to 98 bucks, this ratio would have been reduced to 1.00.</p>
<p>Now think what will happen if there is a run on PC Jewelers&#8217; shares. It&#8217;s non current assets are just 558 crores and its current assets are a whopping 6900 crores.</p>
<p>If there is a run on the share, the liabilities will outstrip market capitalization, creditors will start knocking for payments while debtors may do the vanishing act.</p>
<p>Long story short, avoid companies that have a low  Mcap to Total Liabilities ratio.</p>
<p>These notes will help you fine tune your understanding of the Financial Risk Calculator.</p>
