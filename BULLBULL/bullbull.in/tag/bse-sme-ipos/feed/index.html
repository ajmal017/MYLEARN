All information has been gleaned from the <a href="https://www.nseindia.com/emerge/corporates/content/SPIL_DRHP.pdf">company&#8217;s Red Herring prospectus filed with SEBI</a>.</p>
<p>The company is setting up a plant (paint, thinners, etc.) under license from Sirca, Italy. <a href="http://www.forbesindia.com/article/sponsored/italian-wood-coatings-brand-sirca-indian-counterpart-join-hands-to-set-up-manufacturing-unit/49821/1">Sirca Italy is also investing 5.22% in the Indian company&#8217;s equity</a>. <span style="color: #003300;"><strong>This is a positive</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Sirca Italy has purchased the stock at Rs 120 a share. Another investor, Gita Kriti, has picked up 4,00,000 shares at 150. <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Yet another positive</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Till now, the company imports products majorly from Sirca, Italy, and distributes these in India and to a few SAARC nations. Any appreciation in the $ rate <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">will be a negative for the company</span></strong>. This $ negative will continue until the new manufacturing plant is set up in India.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s net profit after tax margins have shot up from 10% in 2015-16 t0 22% in 2017-18 (9 months). <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Does not look natural for a trading company.</strong></span></p>
<p>The company faces competition from formidable players such as Asian Paints, Kansai Nerolac, Berger Paints, Akzo Nobel and<br />
Shalimar Paints.</p>
<p>Company has experienced negative cash flows. The last 6 months cash flow is positive ONLY because the company has obtained 5.47 crores finance. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Also, the cash loss of 3.38 crores from operations for the last reported 6 months is disturbing</strong></span>.</p>
<p>The BV of the company is 35.27, and it is being offered 4.5 times book, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">which seems expensive</span></strong>.</p>
<p>The promoters hold about 87 lakh shares and their cost works out to about 90 paise (thanks to a 122:1 bonus). Though SME promoters should reward themselves adequately, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>it is disheartening to see that the Sirca stock will cost 160 bucks to the retail investor. There seems to be very little left on the table for the average Joe</strong>.</span></p>
<p>For the 6 month period ending 30-9-17, the sales are 42 crores and the debtors are 30.5 crores and the inventory is 15 crores. That&#8217;s too much. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">It implies the company extends a very generous credit period</span></strong>.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s profit for 6 months ending 30-9-17 is reported at 9.64 cr. Assuming the trend continues in 2018-19, the company will earn 19 crore profit on a post issue capital of 18.27 crores. yielding an EPS of 10.5, which looks good on the face of it. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>However, the sudden spike in the margins and the extended credit granted to debtors cast a shadow over the earnings.</strong></span></p>
<p>The company has taken on lease 9 offices across India for which the lease period has expired. The company continues to occupy these premises and pays rent based on oral negotiations. It also hasn&#8217;t complied with RBI&#8217;s statutory filings in the past.  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>This does not speak well of the company&#8217;s business governance department</strong></span>.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>Though Sirca Paints looks like a fancy issue on the surface, an investor must remember that it is a trading company at the moment. It will set up a plant in the near future and its capacity utilization will be just 25% in the first year. It will take some time for it t become a manufacturing company, and till it becomes a full fledged one, it will remain a trading company.</p>
<p>The low cost of stock acquisition by the promoters, the generous credit forwarded to debtors, the inventory pile up, the sudden spike in margins, and a few other factors do convey the feeling that the issue is fully priced. Plus, it is going up against very formidable and established players in the market that don&#8217;t give any quarter.</p>
<p>However, know that the economics of an SME IPO are very different and once the retail investor quota is absorbed, anything can happen to the stock. Therefore, I can only express whether I would apply t this issue or buy it on listing &#8212; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I WOULD NOT</strong></span>. Rather I&#8217;d wait till it establishes its plant and I&#8217;d keep watching its Q on Q results.</p>
