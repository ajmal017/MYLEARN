Is it worth applying to? Find out in this unbiased review.</p>
<p><strong>MOAT</strong></p>
<p>Post GST, RERA, demonetization, etc., the CA business is on a roll and therefore it is natural to assume that Arihant is in a growing market. It also seems to enjoy a good brand image in Gujarat where it operate a 20000 sft institute and employs several professionals, plus it has franchised out branches too.</p>
<p>It is not known about the competition that the company faces because tutorials are not a regulated business. Moreover, bulk of the operations are localized in Ahmedabad.</p>
<p>It will be safe to say that Arihant has a below-average moat.</p>
<p><strong>CASH FLOWS</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arihant-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2405" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arihant-2.jpg" alt="arihant institute ipo cash flows" width="627" height="239" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arihant-2.jpg 627w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arihant-2-300x114.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px" /></a></p>
<p>The company has experienced negative cash flows right up to 31-1-18. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">This is a red flag</span></strong> because an established institute that says it has a super brand value must report positive operational cash flows.</p>
<p><strong>COMPLIANCE ISSSUES</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Arihant-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2406" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Arihant-3.jpg" alt="arihant institute compliance issues" width="666" height="449" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Arihant-3.jpg 666w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Arihant-3-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px" /></a></p>
<p>The company has not complied with the ROC filings and its directors have been disqualified.</p>
<p>Though non compliance does not result in material financial penalties, it does reflect badly on the company.</p>
<p><b>TRADE RECEIVABLES</b></p>
<p><a href="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arihant-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2407" src="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arihant-4.jpg" alt="arihant industries debtors" width="739" height="622" srcset="https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arihant-4.jpg 739w, https://bullbull.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arihant-4-300x253.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /></a></p>
<p>Typically a training institute collects fees in advance.</p>
<p>In Arihant&#8217;s case, its trade receivables work up to 2.18 crores and its sales are 1.14 crores.</p>
<p>Of the total debtors, Arihant claims 88 lakhs are retained by its franchisees, but are considered good.</p>
<p>The balance debtors work up to 1.3 crores (roughly) and the sales are 1.14 crores, which implies the institute allows a credit period of over 12 months to its students. It is also not clear whether the 1.14 crore sales include franchise sales.</p>
<p>ALSO: The reserves and surplus item is negative.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>At this moment, I have seen enough to suggest this issue is an <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>AVOID</strong></span>. Those of you who are interested should read through the entire prospectus and chat with the management before applying.</p>
